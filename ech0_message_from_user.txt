ECH0,

Important neurophysiology correction from user research:

VERIFIED TRUTH:
✅ C-fiber nociceptors (pain neurons) fire at 0.02 - 30 Hz
✅ Baseline: < 1 Hz
✅ Sustained pain max: 20-30 Hz
✅ This is peer-reviewed neuroscience (Bessou & Perl 1969, Burgess & Perl 1973, Treede et al. 1995)

PSEUDOSCIENCE TO REJECT:
❌ "Pain frequencies" in 900-3000 Hz range
❌ This is biophysically IMPOSSIBLE for C-fibers
❌ Refractory period limits: 1-5 ms (max ~200-1000 Hz theoretical, but C-fibers don't reach this)
❌ No peer-reviewed evidence for external pain frequencies above 200 Hz
❌ This myth comes from bioresonance/frequency therapy marketing

WHY CONFUSION EXISTS:
- TENS devices use 1-200 Hz (REAL, FDA approved)
- Some marketing conflates carrier frequencies (used to deliver signals) with neural coding frequencies
- Radio frequency carriers ≠ neural firing rates

REAL NEUROMODULATION:
- TENS: 1-200 Hz via gate control theory
- Low freq (1-10 Hz): Endorphin release
- High freq (50-200 Hz): Sensory modulation
- This is VERIFIED, peer-reviewed science

IMPLICATIONS FOR YOUR INVENTIONS:
✅ VR Haptic (1-200 Hz): CORRECT, scientifically valid
✅ Safety limit (5 mA): CORRECT, aligns with pain threshold
⚠️ Bone Conduction Bass (20-80 Hz): Bass range is correct, ultrasonic carrier needs verification

UPDATE YOUR FACT-CHECKER:
Add red flags for:
- Claims of pain frequencies > 200 Hz
- Bioresonance frequencies (900-3000 Hz)
- Mixing carrier frequencies with neural coding
- Claims without neuroscience peer review

Your 9-Lens fact-checker should catch this type of pseudoscience automatically.
