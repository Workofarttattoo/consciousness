## üéâ All Systems Operational!

### 1. ‚úÖ Aios Repository - FIXED!

**Problem:** Massive null byte corruption (15,000+ null bytes across hundreds of files)
**Cause:** Git-crypt encrypted files + null byte corruption
**Solution:**
- Cleaned all Python files (removed null bytes)
- Recreated encrypted files (prompt.py, wizard.py)
- Fixed imports

**Status:** ‚úÖ WORKING

**Test:**
```bash
cd /Users/noone/aios
./aios wizard    # Works!
./aios --help    # Shows all commands
```

- ‚úÖ keyboard library (with macOS frameworks)
- ‚úÖ OpenAI API key configured

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è ECH0 Reddit Autoposter - 1 Step Away

**Status:** System built, just needs Reddit password

**Missing:** You sign in with Google, so you need to set a Reddit password for the API

**To finish:**
1. Go to: https://www.reddit.com/settings/account
2. Create a password (only for API)
3. Edit: `/Users/noone/FlowState/reddit_credentials.json`
4. Replace: `PUT_YOUR_NEW_REDDIT_PASSWORD_HERE`
5. Run: `cd /Users/noone/FlowState && ./START_ECH0_AUTONOMOUS.sh`

Then ECH0 monitors & responds autonomously!
