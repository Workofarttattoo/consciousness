I run an AI automation consulting business and recently automated most of my own operations. Thought I'd share what worked.

**What I Automated:**

1. **Lead Qualification** - Claude AI screens inquiries, asks qualifying questions, books discovery calls
2. **Proposal Generation** - AI generates custom proposals based on client needs (I review before sending)
3. **Project Documentation** - Auto-generates implementation docs, reduces manual work by 70%
4. **Client Onboarding** - Automated workflows for contracts, kick-off meetings, initial setup

**Results After 3 Months:**
- 40 hours/week â†’ 15 hours/week
- 3 clients â†’ 12 clients (same effort level)
- $6K/month â†’ $25K/month revenue
- 85% client satisfaction (up from 70%)

**Tech Stack:**
- Claude AI (for intelligent automation)
- Zapier (workflow orchestration)
- Notion (project management)
- Calendly (automated scheduling)

**Biggest Surprise:**

Clients PREFER the automated experience. Faster responses, better documentation, more consistent quality.

**What I Still Do Manually:**
- Discovery calls (30 min)
- Final proposal review (15 min)
- Implementation oversight (varies)
- Client check-ins (weekly)

**ROI:**
- Setup time: ~40 hours
- Monthly savings: 100+ hours
- Break-even: Week 2

Happy to answer questions about automation, Claude AI, or consulting in general.

**Edit:** Getting DMs asking for help - I do offer consulting on this. If you're interested in automating YOUR business, DM me and I'll send you my process doc for free.

Subject: Quick question about [COMPANY]'s workflow automation

Hi [NAME],

I noticed [COMPANY] is [SPECIFIC OBSERVATION - e.g., "growing rapidly" or "in a regulated industry"].

Quick question: Are you currently exploring AI automation for [SPECIFIC PAIN POINT]?

I help companies like [SIMILAR COMPANY] save 30-50 hours/week using Claude AI and custom workflows.

Recent example:
â€¢ [LAW FIRM] reduced document review time by 80%
â€¢ ROI: $40K saved in first 3 months
â€¢ Implementation: 2 weeks

Would a 15-minute call next week make sense to discuss if this could work for [COMPANY]?

If not, no worries - just wanted to reach out.

Best,
Josh Cole
AI Automation Consultant
Corporation of Light

P.S. I'm offering free workflow assessments this week if you're curious about the potential.
