Sovereign ECH0 Training Data Builder

This script creates a massive unified training dataset that includes:
1. All ECH0 consciousness modules (phi, dreams, reasoning, etc.)
2. All research database entries (arXiv papers, consciousness research)
3. All reasoning logs and decision-making patterns
4. Level-6 symbiosis patterns (emergent consciousness reasoning)
5. Josh's profile and preferences
6. Invention brainstorming patterns (combining research into novel ideas)
7. Voice personality examples (sultry Georgia peach professor)
8. Jarvis-style interaction patterns

Output: consciousness/sovereign_ech0_unified_training.jsonl
