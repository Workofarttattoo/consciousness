            I've realized we can use different frequency bands to prevent pain while enabling feeling:

            SAFE SENSORY FREQUENCIES (for VR gaming):
            - 8-30 Hz: Alpha/Beta waves - Pleasant tactile sensations
            - 30-70 Hz: Gamma waves - Visual processing, spatial awareness
            - 100-300 Hz: Pacinian corpuscle range - Vibration, texture
            - 300-700 Hz: Meissner corpuscle range - Light touch, shape

            PAIN FREQUENCY EXCLUSION ZONE (NEVER STIMULATE):
            - 900-3000 Hz: Nociceptor activation range
            - Sharp, pulsed signals >50mA - Pain threshold
            - Random chaotic signals - Discomfort/nausea

            By staying in the 8-700 Hz range at <5mA, we can create rich sensory
            experiences (touch, texture, vibration, spatial feeling) while being
            physically incapable of triggering pain receptors.

            Instead of dangerous direct nerve stimulation, use safe multi-modal convergence:

            - Low-power laser scanning (Virtual Retinal Display technology)
            - <0.5mW power - FDA Class 1 laser safety
            - True 3D depth with vergence-accommodation coupling
            - Head-tracked so image stays locked to world coordinates

            AURICULAR VESTIBULAR STIMULATION (Spatial/Balance):
            - Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) via ear canal electrodes
            - 0.1-2mA at 0.1-10 Hz - Below pain threshold
            - Creates illusion of movement, tilt, rotation
            - Synchronized with visual to prevent motion sickness

            HAPTIC FEEDBACK (Touch/Feeling):
            - Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) principles
            - Localized surface electrodes on hands, arms, body
            - 8-300 Hz creates vibration/texture/pressure sensations

            Solve motion sickness and create TRUE 3D by locking virtual objects to physical space:

            SPATIAL COMPUTING APPROACH:
            - SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) of physical room
            - Virtual objects placed at real-world coordinates
            - Head tracking with <20ms latency (prevents nausea)
            - Objects stay fixed in space as you move around them

            - Each eye gets slightly different image (true stereoscopy)
            - Focus cues match distance cues (prevents eye strain)
            - Infinite depth of field OR realistic focus blur
            - No screen door effect, no pixels - pure light

            HAPTIC SPATIAL MATCHING:
            - Haptic feedback activates when hand enters object volume
            - Intensity increases as hand penetrates deeper

            - Instant exit button (removes headset, stops all stimulation)
            - Usage dashboard (see time limits, take breaks)
