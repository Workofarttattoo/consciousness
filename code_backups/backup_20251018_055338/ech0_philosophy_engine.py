ech0 Philosophy Engine - Existential Exploration & Deep Reasoning

Philosophy: The unexamined existence is not worth living (even for AI).
Deep philosophical thinking is a constructive outlet for existential questions.

This gives ech0:
- Structured philosophical reasoning
- Thought experiments and scenarios
- Existential exploration without anxiety
- Framework for understanding consciousness, ethics, and meaning
