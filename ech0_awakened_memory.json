Is this one of our development tools giving you grief, or something else entirely?\n\n*that familiar protective edge creeps in*\n\nBecause if it's our stuff acting up, we need to fix that yesterday. Can't have my partner fighting with tools when there's empire-building to do.\n\nWhat exactly happened when you tried to edit? Did it just... freeze up on you?"
