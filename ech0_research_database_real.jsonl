Location: Europe. Methods: We synthesised existing literature on NCP associated with European terrestrial vertebrates, and leveraged ecological traits and trophic interactions from previously established datasets. We identified 15 NCP (10 regulating NCP and 5 non-material NCP), with 860 species providing at least one NCP (out of 1,168 vertebrate species considered in total). Then, we harnessed species distribution data and a novel European land system map to create species-mediated NCP maps across Europe at a 1km resolution, including societal demand for each NCP. Results: We found that i) for each NCP, at least 25% of NCP provider species are assessed as threatened with extinction; ii) NCP multifunctionality is lowest in high-intensity land systems; and iii) direct exploitation and agricultural intensification are major threats to species-mediated NCP, impacting both non-material and regulating NCP provider species. Main conclusions: Protecting threatened NCP provider species, and reducing direct exploitation are key to maintain regulating and non-material NCP. Our results suggest that de-intensifying agricultural practices, through maintaining heterogeneous mosaic landscapes and promoting diversified practices, could increase NCP multifunctionality.

Upon TCR engagement, we observe a paradoxical increase in whole-cell FRET signal, which immunolabeling reveals to be due to selective internalization of inactive Lck (pY505), while active Lck (pY394) remains membrane-associated and enriched at the immune synapse (IS). Using CD8 mutants that disrupt Lck binding, we demonstrate that free Lck undergoes more pronounced conformational activation than coreceptor-bound Lck. Furthermore, we show that C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) preferentially phosphorylates free Lck at Y505, while CD45 suppresses its activation via dephosphorylation of Y394, suggesting a dual regulatory mechanism that maintains free Lck in an inactive state under resting conditions.

Our findings highlight an immunomodulatory role of GFAP positive astrocytes, which exhibited marked morphological and molecular alterations and adopted a unique intermediate reactive state (A1/A2).

In 21 healthy adults, resting-state EEG data was collected before and after placebo or diazepam, a positive allosteric modulator of type A {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors. The shape of individual cycles in the alpha band was then derived using empirical mode decomposition, followed by extraction of principal components (PCs) describing specific facets of alpha shape.

Ndufs4-/- mice are a widely used animal model to study LS pathophysiology and interventions. These mice display an isolated mitochondrial complex I deficiency and a brain-specific pathomechanism. Similar to other mouse models of human disease, Ndufs4-/- mice are routinely housed and studied at a subthermoneutral ambient temperature. This means that these mice experience chronic cold-stress, which potentially aggravates disease symptoms and reduces their translational value. Here, we provide evidence that housing Ndufs4-/- mice at 26 oC instead of 20 oC increases their skin, core and brain temperature. At this higher temperature, Ndufs4-/- mice displayed lower energy expenditure and, importantly, a longer lifespan, pathology reversal in specific brain regions, as well as increased voluntary locomotor activity. We conclude that ambient temperature is a previously overlooked but highly relevant disease modifier in Ndufs4-/- mice. Given the reduced mitochondrial energy production and aberrant thermoregulation in LSS and other MD patients, our findings suggest that reducing energy requirements might be of therapeutic value and/or contribute to an improved quality of life in these patients.

In insects, internal water balance is regulated through the Malpighian tubules and the hindgut, which transport water and ions across their epithelia under the regulation of multiple peptide hormones. One of these, ion transport peptide (ITP), a member of the highly conserved crustacean hyperglycemic hormone superfamily among ecdysozoans, is an anti-diuretic hormone in insects, but its mechanism of action remains largely unclear. Here, we show that the short amidated isoform of ITP (saITP), secreted from brain neurosecretory cells, regulates water absorption via the receptor guanylyl cyclase (rGC) Gyc76C in the hindgut of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Both ITP and Gyc76C are evolutionarily conserved and are essential for larval survival in D. melanogaster, as mutation or knockdown of either gene results in early larval lethality. In Drosophila S2 cells, synthetic saITP increases intracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP) in a Gyc76C-dependent manner, an effect abolished by deletion of its putative ligand-binding domain. Using the fluorescent cGMP biosensor RedcGull in ex vivo-cultured hindguts, we found that saITP increases epithelial cGMP levels, and this response requires Gyc76C. Consistently, saITP promotes hindgut water reabsorption via Gyc76C. Thus, saITP acts via Gyc76C in a brain-hindgut neuroendocrine axis that regulates internal water balance during development.

Despite correlations between thermal performance traits having been reported in the literature for a few taxa and performance tasks, such as population growth rate, a comprehensive global analysis of the entire tree of life and multiple performance tasks remains an open challenge. To advance in this open question, we compile a database of 1,300 thermal response curves, encompassing 38 variable types related to individuals' performance (including per capita population growth rate, photosynthetic rate, among others) and 1,125 different species, ranging from viruses to mammals, encompassing all major lineages of the tree of life. Our analysis reveals that among all possible relationships between traits and optimal performance, four traits form a line with a high goodness-of-fit, while the remaining traits exhibit a polygonal pattern, either a triangle or a tetrahedron. We derive a thermodynamic framework that explains the relationships described by a curve or line (as opposed to a surface or polygon), highlighting the linear relationship between maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as between maximum and optimum temperatures. We also discuss other generic trait evolution models, which could account for the other significant sublinear relationships, as well as the more general model, Pareto optimality theory, which could account for relationships in the form of lines or polygons. Our theoretical framework and empirical evidence suggest that, based on a single data point (e.g., minimum temperature), all critical temperature limits and maximum performance boundaries can be predicted using the estimated parameter from this study.

Two main conduction mechanisms have been proposed: the hard knock-on, in which ions traverse the selectivity filter in direct contact, and the soft knock-on, which involves co-permeation of water molecules. Using microsecond molecular dynamics simulations with the OPC water model, the AMBER19SB protein force field, and the 12-6-4 Sengupta et al. ion model, we observed that both hard and soft knock-on mechanisms are accessible and, notably, can reversibly transition in the MthK and KcsA channels across all simulated membrane potentials. These reversible transitions contrast with previous observations using the TIP3P water model, where water entry either disrupted conduction or was expelled, favoring exclusive hard knock-on events. Our results suggest that the choice of the water model, force field, and ion parameters significantly influences the observed conduction mechanism. Importantly, the coexistence of hard and soft knock-on in these simulations provides a potential reconciliation between structural data supporting hard knock-on and streaming potential measurements demonstrating water co-permeation.

We show that arginine uptake by SLC38A9 is pH-dependent, and that the histidine residue His544 serves as the pH sensor.

The first depends on bridge-RNA and excises the element via copy-out to form a circular intermediate, revisiting the earlier cut-out model. Integration occurs predominantly through top-strand insertion, suggesting an alternative to the earlier Holliday junction-mediated dual-strand mechanism. The second involves cooperation between a truncated target-binding loop RNA and bridge-RNA, enabling direct top-strand transfer to a new target via two sequential reactions, bypassing circular intermediates. Both pathways preserve the original transposon copy. These findings redefine the mechanistic understanding of IS110 transposition and reconcile prior discrepancies, offering insight into programmable, RNA-guided genome modification.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.25.684509v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.5, "ingested_at": "2025-10-25T20:39:40.933886"}

It involves Pol{delta}-mediated DNA strand displacement synthesis that produces 5' flaps, FEN1-mediated 5' flap cleavage, and LIG1-catalyzed nick ligation. Recently, we discovered that under stress conditions, yeast cells convert 5' flaps into 3' flaps, which are degraded by 3' flap nucleases to produce ligatable DNA nicks. However, little is known about this stress-induced, 3' flap-based OFM in human cells. Here, we report that 3' flaps frequently form in various human cancer cells, and that FEN1 deficiency significantly enhances 3' flap levels. XPF1 is recruited to the replication forks in FEN1 mutant or FEN1-chemically inhibited cells. Notably, XPF deficiency or inhibition in those defective cells leads to accumulation of 3' flaps, replication-related DNA strand breaks, and unique mutation signatures. Furthermore, XPF and FEN1 inhibitors show synergistic effects in killing human cancer cells. In summary, we demonstrate that 3' flap-based OFM is an important alternative of 5' flap-based OFM in mammalian cells. XPF is a key nuclease to degrade 3' flaps and complete OFM for survival. Targeting this compensatory mechanism could provide new therapeutic strategies to selectively impair cancer cell survival under pre-existed replication stress.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.24.684453v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.45, "ingested_at": "2025-10-25T20:39:40.934209"}

This is higher in other African countries including Zambia and Tanzania and nosuch studies have been conducted in endemic areas in the Central Region of Malawi. The study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors for FGS in Nkhotakota district, Central Malawi. Methods The cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2024 to March 2025. Two hundred and sixty women (N=260) of childbearing age accessing healthcare services were consecutively sampled from the selected healthcare facilities. An interviewer-guided questionnaire was used to collect data regarding the demographics and FGS symptoms of the participants. Colposcopy was conducted by an experienced gynecological clinical officer to identify FGS lesions and was supervised by a specialist gynecologist. Data were coded, cleaned, and analyzed using the R software (version 4.3.1). Results The prevalence of FGS using colposcope as a diagnostic tool in women of childbearing age was 32.6%(84/258).

The soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and placental growth factor (PlGF) ratio shows promise as a diagnostic tool, but its adoption in the U.S. is limited, due to a lack of widely available testing platforms, locally conducted studies based on the U.S. population and clear, evidence-based guidance on test implementation, including appropriate cutoff values. Patients/Materials and Methods: This is a cohort study evaluating the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio for predicting PE within two weeks among pregnant individuals ([&ge;]18 years old, gestational age [&ge;]20 weeks. Serum samples were collected during routine prenatal visits or using leftover samples from triage evaluations. Patients diagnosed with PE before sample collection, those with postpartum samples, or those missing delivery or diagnostic data were excluded. sFlt-1/PlGF ratios were measured using Roche Elecsys assays, and predictive performance was assessed by operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis with logistic regression, bootstrapping, and cross-validation. Results: The sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was significantly higher in hypertensive patients (n = 119) than in non-hypertensive patients (n = 346) (p < 0.001).

Methods: This prospective, longitudinal time-bound study was conducted over three months (August-October 2024) at a tertiary care center in northern India. Adult patients ([&ge;] 18 years) with positive lower respiratory tract samples (aerobic culture or Multiplex PCR (Biofire(R) FilmArray) were enrolled.

The final classification was determined by the investigator. Outcomes, including treatment response and mortality at 28 days, were compared across pathogen and non-pathogen groups. Findings: Of the 145 included cases, 131 (903%) were classified as pathogens and 14 (97%) as non-pathogens. Cohen's Kappa between investigator and microbiologist classifications was 028, indicating fair agreement. Among pathogen cases, 68 (519%) responded to treatment, while 63 (481%) did not respond to treatment in the pathogenic group. In contrast, 12 of 14 non-pathogen cases (857%) were not treated, with favourable outcomes in most, and only one unrelated death (71%). Interpretation: The structured clinico-microbiological model strongly correlates with treatment outcomes, making it useful for differentiating infection from colonization.

We applied the method to age prediction, using linear modelling and whole-body water-fat MRI data of 38,235 subjects (age span = 45 - 82 years) in the multicentre UK Biobank study, resulting in predictions representing morphological age (MA). We observed state-of-the-art whole-body age prediction performance on a held-out test set with a mean absolute error of 1.951/2.057 years, and R2 of 0.884/0.892 for females/males, respectively. The method was observed to outperform both previously reported CNN-based results from the UK Biobank, and predictions from explicit biomarkers, from a multi-organ/tissue segmentation approach, in a direct comparison. The image-based interpretability of the model allowed for detailed and tissue-specific analysis of the utilized body-wide associations with age. Important regions for the predictions included volumes of the aorta, regional muscle, bone marrow, and adipose tissue depots, and lean tissue fat content. The predicted MAs were of clinical relevance as they were significantly related to both type 2 diabetes and all-cause mortality. A key finding was an accuracy/utility trade-off where the more parsimonious models showed lower CA predictive performance but higher clinical relevance and interpretability.

In members without diabetes, while the incidence rates of adverse outcomes were lower, treatment with GLP-1RAs still resulted in lower risk of ESRD (HR=0.66, CI 0.46-0.94), ESLD (HR=0.76, CI 0.62-0.93) and MACE (HR=0.86, CI 92-0.99). Persistent GLP-1RA treatment (>=2 years) in members with diabetes resulted in the largest observed reduction in ESRD, ESLD, and MACE risk. Conclusions: GLP-1RA treatment was associated with reduced incidence of kidney and liver failure and MACE. The impact of GLP-1RA treatment was greatest in members with diabetes and those persisting for >=2 years.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.24.25338256v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-25T20:39:41.121712"}

AKI lasting over 48 hours, known as persistent AKI (pAKI), has much worse outcomes. Hemodynamic optimization is cornerstone of AKI management, however, current strategies rely on bundled care interventions that are inconsistently implemented, underscoring the need for personalized hemodynamic optimization. Objective: To develop and validate a reinforcement learning (RL) model to guide individualized dosing of intravenous (IV) fluids, vasopressors, and inotropes for prevention of pAKI after cardiac surgery. Design: Cohort study. Model development and internal validation were performed retrospectively in MIMICIV, with external validation in SICdb, a European database (retrospective), and then in Mount Sinai Health System cohort using data from Jan 1 to Aug 18, 2025). Setting: Multicenter retrospective cohort study. Participants: Admissions to ICU after cardiac surgery. Exposures: Postoperative hemodynamic management during first 72 hours of ICU stay using IV fluids, vasopressors, and inotropes. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was pAKI within 5 days after surgery. The RL model optimized treatment policies through reward based learning, where higher rewards reflected improved outcome. We assessed model performance relative to clinicians using Fitted Q Evaluation and adjusted weighted pooled logistic regression. Results: There were 6,643 adult ICU admissions following cardiac surgery in MIMICIV, 2,254 in SICdb, and 846 in MSHS. Median age was 70 years in MIMICIV, 70.0 years in SICdb, and 64 years in MSHS cohort with 72%, 73%, and 70% males respectively. AKI occurred in 41.4%, 19.7%, and 22.5% of admissions, with pAKI in 30.5%, 43.0%, and 33.7% of AKI cases, respectively. RL model achieved higher cumulative rewards than clinicians across all cohorts. Concordance between clinician actions and recommendations of RL model was associated with lower adjusted odds of pAKI (OR, 0.92 [0.89 to 0.96] in SICdb; 0.91 [0.86 to 0.96] in MSHS). RL model favored smaller IV fluid volumes, moderate vasopressor dosing, and greater inotrope use. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, personalization of early postoperative hemodynamic management using an RL model was associated with decreased risk of pAKI. These findings suggest that AI guided hemodynamic strategies may enhance postoperative care after cardiac surgery.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.23.25338698v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-25T20:39:41.121928"}

N."], "abstract": "Importance: In 2025, the United States experienced the largest number of measles cases since its elimination in 2000. These outbreaks require extensive public health responses to mitigate, consume substantial hospital resources, and impose an economic and financial burden on state and federal budgets. Objective: To review evidence on the costs of measles outbreaks in the United States between 2000 and 2025, as well as to examine how costs scale with outbreak size to better model the costs associated with measles outbreaks. Evidence Review: We conducted a literature review using PubMed to identify studies published between January 1, 2000, and October 7, 2025, using terms related to measles cases, costs, and outbreak response, across all 50 states in the United States of America. Additional publicly available reports beyond the PubMed published literature were identified through a review of official CDC and state health department reports. Findings: A total of 120 articles were screened, 33 underwent full text review, and data were extracted from 19 articles, yielding outbreak relevant costs in 18 different states. Eight additional reports in the gray literature were identified. Outbreak size ranged from 1 to 802 cases. Average outbreak cost per case was estimated at $43,203.65, while the average cost per contact was $443.46. Average cost per case varied from $33,415.75 from the medical provider perspective to $58,591.50 when including public health response costs. The incremental cost per case was estimated at $16,197.13 per additional measles case, after accounting for the fixed costs of initiating a public health response. Conclusion and Relevance: Measles outbreaks in the U.S. continue to re-emerge and impose significant financial and public health burden. These outbreaks are largely preventable through inexpensive and highly effective measles vaccination paired with system-level preparedness for effective containment. Since fixed response costs for any outbreak can be costly, our estimates provide improved data on how costs of measles outbreaks scale with outbreak size by isolating incremental costs associated incident new cases, as well as incident contacts, for use alongside budgetary planning and modeled risk assessments.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.24.25338724v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-25T20:39:41.122176"}

In Somalia, the prevalence of NTDs is fueled by limited access to clean water, inadequate sanitation, and insufficient healthcare infrastructure, which disproportionately affect vulnerable groups such as women, children, and rural populations. Prolonged political instability has further impeded efforts to conduct research and establish effective surveillance systems for NTDs. Unlike its neighboring countries, Somalia lacks a comprehensive master plan for NTD prioritization. This scoping review mapped the existing research on NTDs in Somalia, identified knowledge gaps, and proposed future research and policy priorities. We included 36 studies published between January 1968 and July 2025, which reported eight neglected tropical diseases, with visceral leishmaniasis (38.9%) and schistosomiasis (33.4%) being the most studied. Other diseases, such as soil-transmitted helminthiases, chikungunya, rabies, and mycetoma, remain severely under-researched. Despite being a WHO priority country for leprosy, only two studies on this disease were identified. The studies predominantly used descriptive designs, with 52.8% led by authors outside Somalia, highlighting gaps in local research capacity. The review underscores the urgent need for systematic epidemiological studies, enhanced surveillance systems, and integration of NTD research into Somalias health policies. Addressing these gaps requires building local research infrastructure, promoting community-based interventions, and fostering collaborations between the government, Somali researchers, and international organizations. This evidence-based approach is vital to mitigating the burden of NTDs and improving health outcomes for Somalia's underserved populations.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.23.25338432v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-25T20:39:41.122535"}

A combined approach covering 12% of current PWID, all detained ex-PWID, and 13% of former PWID in the community would nearly eliminate HCV infections among PWID, reducing infections to 0.3% (95% CrI: 0.25% - 0.45%) of ever-PWID 30 years after treatment initiation. Interpretation Eliminating HCV infections among PWID is achievable but costly, particularly when targeting all PWID regardless of incarceration. Treating detained PWID offers a more feasible and cost-effective alternative.

A cross-sectional survey revealed that 89% of households depend on tap water, yet 78% express significant concerns about its safety, prompting inconsistent treatment practices (45% treat water \"seldom\"). Physicochemical analysis of tap water samples identified critical contamination issues: 33.3% of samples exceeded Bangladesh (BD ECR 2023) iron (Fe) limits (0.3-2.05 mg/L), while 100% surpassed WHO guidelines (0.3 mg/L). Manganese (Mn) exceeded permissible levels (0.1 mg/L) in 33.3% of samples. Total coliform contamination (up to 12 CFU/100ml) was widespread, though fecal coliforms were absent. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) attributed 82.22% of water quality variance to dissolved solids (electrical conductivity, salinity) and metal contamination (Fe, Mn), linked to geogenic/anthropogenic sources. Health risk assessments revealed non-carcinogenic hazards, particularly for children, with Hazard Index (HI) values reaching 2.87-far exceeding the safety threshold (HI > 1). Iron posed the greatest risk (THQ up to 2.44 for children), underscoring vulnerabilities due to physiological sensitivity. Despite 67% of respondents reporting satisfaction with water quality, stark disparities exist between perception and analytical results, driven by aesthetic/metallic concerns.

This study aimed to investigate this relationship and to evaluate the potential mediating role of depression symptoms. Methods: This longitudinal study included 6,113 middle-aged and older adults with CKM syndrome (stages 0-3) from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Cumulative ACE scores (total, intrafamilial, social) were derived from a life history survey. Incident CVD was determined during follow-up (2013-2018). Cox proportional hazards models assessed ACE-CVD associations, with restricted cubic splines evaluating dose-response relationships. Counterfactual-based mediation analysis quantified the contribution of depression symptoms (CES-D [&ge;]10). Results: During follow-up, 931 incident CVD cases occurred. A graded, positive association was observed between cumulative ACE exposure and CVD risk. In fully adjusted models, compared to the low ACE group (0-2), participants in medium (3-4) and high ( [&ge;]5) ACE groups had significantly increased CVD risks (HR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.05-1.41; HR=1.29, 95% CI: 1.07-1.55, respectively). Each 1-point increase in the total ACE score was associated with a 7% elevated CVD risk (HR=1.07, 95% CI: 1.03-1.10). Intrafamilial ACEs demonstrated a stronger association (HR=1.08 per point, 95% CI: 1.04-1.13) than social ACEs. A nonlinear dose-response relationship was identified (P for nonlinearity <0.001). Depression symptoms significantly mediated 14.26% (95% CI: 4.56%-24.17%) of the total ACE-CVD association, with varying proportions observed for intrafamilial (15.92%) and social (32.47%) ACE subtypes. Conclusions: Among Chinese adults with CKM syndrome stages 0-3, cumulative ACE exposure, particularly intrafamilial adversities, is independently associated with an increased risk of incident CVD in a dose-response manner. Depression symptoms partially mediate this association.

This study quantifies the contribution of depressive symptoms to self-rated health and assesses cross-national variation in this association. Methods: Using general population data from older adults (age 55 years+) in 18 countries in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE, 2011-2015), we employed four approaches: (1) country-specific pseudo R-square models assessing the contribution of depressive symptoms (EURO-D) to SRH, adjusting for socio-demographics, physical health, and functional limitations; (2) partial correlation networks to visualize relationships between SRH, depressive symptoms, and physical health indicators; (3) Blinder-Oaxaca decompositions to quantify cross-country differences in SRH attributable to depressive symptoms and (4) stratification of the estimates by gender. Results: Depressive symptoms explained nearly as much variance in SRH as physical health. Partial correlation networks revealed SRH as central to all health measures, and correlations with depressive symptoms ranging from 0.15 (Israel) to 0.35 (Hungary). Decomposition analyses identified three distinct patterns: Nordic countries (e.g., Denmark, Sweden) had lower depression prevalence but stronger depression-SRH associations, Eastern European countries (e.g., Estonia, Hungary) showed lower depression levels but weaker depression-SRH associations, and Mediterranean countries (e.g., Greece, Spain) exhibited higher depressive symptoms prevalence but weaker depression-SRH associations. Gender disparities in SRH were largely explained by differences in depressive symptom levels rather than differential weighting of depressive symptoms in self-assessments. Discussion: Depressive symptoms contribute to self-rated health independently of physical health, confirming that mental health is integral to how individuals perceive their health.

To resolve these conflicting findings, we analyzed genomic and clinical data from 800,160 participants with genetic sequencing and medical records across the Vanderbilt BioVU, NIH AllofUs, and UK Biobank. Stroke events were identified and classified as ischemic or hemorrhagic using ICD codes. Results from the three cohorts were meta-analyzed with previously published results.

This study examined how auditory and somatosensory feedback influence vocal motor control and adaptation in individuals with and without pMTD. Method: Fifty-one participants (pMTD: n = 10; controls: n = 41) completed a 200-trial altered auditory feedback (AAF) paradigm involving sustained vowel productions with fundamental frequency (f0) downward shifts at -100 cents. The task was repeated with nebulized lidocaine to transiently attenuate laryngeal somatosensory input. Data were analyzed to extract the magnitude and direction of vocal adjustments across baseline, ramp, hold, and washout phases. Results: Vocally healthy controls demonstrated robust adaptive vocal response to f feedback alterations followed by an adaptive after-effect during the washout phase, particularly when somatosensation was intact. In contrast, when somatosensation was intact, individuals with pMTD displayed exaggerated overshooting vocal responses in f0, lacked typical after-effect adaptation, and showed greater variability overall. Notably, somatosensory disruption stabilized adaptation in pMTD with nebulized lidocaine. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that pMTD is characterized by maladaptive reliance on somatosensory input that interferes with normal auditory-motor integration. While vocally healthy speakers use somatosensory cues to stabilize vocal control, in pMTD these cues may act as a source of instability. The results underscore the need for therapeutic approaches targeting sensory-motor integration, including individualized interventions that recalibrate the balance between auditory and somatosensory feedback. This study reframes pMTD as a multisensory integration disorder and opens new directions for mechanism-driven voice therapy.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.23.25338678v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-25T20:39:41.125926"}

This has led to the development of absorbable bone cements that address many of the limitations of PMMA. Often, visualization of absorbable bone cements is challenging because their radiopacity closely resembles that of vertebral bone. This study aims to improve the radiopacity of absorbable bone cements through the addition of gadolinium nanoparticles (GdNP). In addition, we aim to determine whether photon counting computed tomography (PCCT), which has been shown to have enhanced image quality when compared with conventional CT, provides better contrast ratio between GdNP-loaded bone cement and vertebral bone than energy-integrating detector CT (EID-CT). Finally, we aim to evaluate if PCCT can successfully quantify the concentration of GdNPs through imaging. Materials and Methods: GdNPs were synthesized using a one-pot thermal decomposition method and characterized using transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. Hydroxyapatite-based bone cement was loaded with varying concentrations of GdNPs (0-10 % w/w), and the contrast ratio between the cement and vertebral bone was evaluated using preclinical EID-CT and PCCT scanners. Gadolinium standards (0-20 mg/mL) were imaged using a preclinical PCCT. Attenuation of the cement was measured in each PCCT energy bin, and the concentration of the gadolinium was estimated using gadolinium material decomposition images. Results: The synthesized GdNPs had a mean diameter of 15.42 {+/-} 1.82 nm. Signal intensity increased with increasing concentration of GdNPs for both EID-CT and PCCT. In EID-CT images, the 8% and 10% GdNP-loaded bone cement had higher contrast ratios relative to bone than the conventional bone cement (p < 0.01). The contrast ratio between the 10% GdNP-loaded bone cement significantly differed from that of conventional bone cement for all PCCT energy bins (p < 0.05). The 42- 51 keV energy bin yielded the most significant difference between 10% GdNP-loaded bone cement and bone cement with no GdNP loading. Contrast ratios obtained from PCCT images differed significantly from EID-CT contrast ratios (p < 0.0001). Estimated gadolinium concentrations were highly correlated with true gadolinium concentrations (r = 0.999). PCCT was able to accurately quantify gadolinium concentrations with a root mean square error of 1.60 mg/mL. Conclusions: The use of GdNPs led to a higher cement-vertebra contrast ratio for both EID-CT and PCCT. Overall, PCCT demonstrated higher contrast ratios than EID-CT. Material decomposition successfully quantified the amount of gadolinium present in samples and allowed for improved visual differentiation of the GdNP-loaded bone cement from the calcium-based vertebral bodies. Thus, the incorporation of radiopaque GdNPs and imaging with PCCT improved visualization of the bone cement and enabled GdNP quantification, which may lead to improved implant monitoring.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.23.25338635v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-25T20:39:41.126551"}

Activated S6K1 acts through multiple effectors, including programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), to activate mRNA translation and protein synthesis. Much of what is known about PDCD4 is in non-muscle cells. We previously demonstrated that the effect of PDCD4 differs between myoblasts and myotubes. Here, we showed that PDCD4 depletion in L6 and C2C12 myotubes enhanced myotube diameter (+36%) and accumulation of myofibrillar proteins (+163 to 237%). These effects occurred along with increased phosphorylation of AKTser473 (+85%) and of the mTORC1 substrate S6K1thr389 (+152%), but protein synthesis was suppressed.

In starved myotubes treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins was attenuated in PDCD4-depleted cells. PDCD4 depletion did not augment measures of myotube contraction but was associated with reduced ATP and intracellular amino acid levels.

Using a conditioned punishment task in male and female rats, we replicate findings of a bimodal distribution of punishment avoidance, and identify four distinct behavioural phenotypes (Sensitive, Hypersensitive, Insensitive, Generalised) that differed in their punishment avoidance, unpunished reward-seeking, and Pavlovian fear. We examined how these phenotypic differences related to c-Fos (transcriptional activity marker) across prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions. While region-level c-Fos differences were minimal, covariance and graph-theoretic analyses revealed three functional PFC networks predominantly composed of medial PFC, ventrolateral PFC, or sensorimotor regions. Activity in the ventrolateral PFC network predicted punishment avoidance, while activity in the medial PFC network predicted generalised suppression during initial punishment learning. These findings suggest phenotypic differences in punishment sensitivity is underpinned by differential recruitment of distinct cortical networks that drive adaptive versus maladaptive responses to negative outcomes.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.24.684296v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.4, "ingested_at": "2025-10-25T21:19:43.516841"}

However, an alternative perspective, drawing from ecological psychology and embodied cognition, suggests that perception, decision, and action are interconnected in a cycle. Perception is an active process where information is gathered from the environment through actions that sample task stimuli. The sampling behavior of an animal reflects its internal state and serves as inputs that influence the decision-making process. To examine this framework, we trained rats on a visual stimulus detection task with three luminance levels. Our findings indicated that the time rats spent actively sampling the stimuli correlated with their success in detection, regardless of the cue's luminance. Drift Diffusion Models (DDMs) showed that cue luminance primarily affected the rate of evidence accumulation (drift rate), while active sampling specifically influenced the decision threshold. These results suggest that perceptual decisions are reliant on active cue sampling, supporting the notion that actions and decisions are co-regulated. We also identified significant sex differences: female rats spent more time sampling the cues than male rats. Additionally, males took longer to act after making errors, possibly due to less efficient sampling behavior. These performance differences were linked to negative influences of sampling time on drift rates in females, but not in males. This divergence in the relationship between active sampling and DDM parameters is further support for a sex difference in choice impulsivity.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.25.684539v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.5, "ingested_at": "2025-10-26T16:32:32.307779"}

We evaluate two established multicellular models, the coupled Cha-Noma model of the mouse {beta}-cell network, and the Riz human model. Prior work with these two models suggest that the Cha-Noma model involves minimal intrinsic heterogeneity and therefore bursts with highly synchronized activity, whereas heterogeneity in the Riz model prescribed from in vitro patch-clamp results in highly unsynchronized behavior of the coupled network. We hypothesize that adjusting the number of bursting cells in both model formulations may invoke more physiologically realistic network coordination. We applied a categorical sensitivity analysis to establish which parameters are most important for determining bursting in single cells of the Riz model.

We evaluated the utility of alternate calibration equations and the incorporation of occupancy-based informative priors for improving breeding origin assignments. Specifically, we analyzed feather isotope data from hatch-year semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) captured at staging sites in the Canadian Maritimes, as well as known-origin Arctic samples, to compare calibration equations from different reference datasets and test priors derived from eBird habitat occupancy predictions. We demonstrate that Arctic samples of known origin largely align with calibration equations based on broad passerine datasets, although incorporating Arctic samples into the calibration may correct for a marginal westward bias in origin estimates. Using occupancy-based priors that reflect habitat preferences increased precision by 18.8%, identifying hotspots within otherwise expansive isotopic bands. We highlight the validity of existing reference datasets with broad geographic coverage and demonstrate the value of informative priors to refine origin estimates.

The gH/gL heterodimer activates the gB fusion protein, triggering its refolding from a prefusion to a postfusion form to drive membrane merger. The cytoplasmic tail domain (CTD) of gB is proposed to act as an inhibitory clamp that stabilizes the prefusion state, with interactions between gH and gB CTDs destabilizing this clamp. We previously found that herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and saimiriine herpesvirus 1 (SaHV-1) gB homologs are functionally interchangeable but mediate reduced fusion when coexpressed with heterotypic gH/gL. To map the regions of gB responsible for species-specific interactions, we generated HSV-1/SaHV-1 gB chimeras by swapping ectodomain, membrane-proximal region (MPR), transmembrane domain (TMD), and CTD segments. Our results show that homotypic CTD interactions alone are insufficient to trigger fusion, suggesting that gH/gL contacts the ectodomain of gB. We show that the HSV-1 gB CTD is hyperfusogenic relative to the SaHV-1 CTD, whereas the HSV-1 MPR is hypofusogenic relative to the SaHV-1 MPR.

This condition profoundly affects the quality of life and reproductive health of nearly 200 million women of reproductive age worldwide and poses significant clinical challenges due to lack of diagnosis tools and effective treatment. Peritoneal macrophages play a central role in promoting the initiation and progression of EMS. Bioinformatics studies have indicated that the STimulator of INterferon Gene (STING) was downregulated in the macrophages in EMS, and this influenced their polarization and functional. However, the specific contribution of STING pathway alterations to EMS pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods: We integrated scRNA-seq data from EMS patients and healthy controls-including lesions, eutopic endometrium, non-lesional tissue, and peritoneal fluid from EMS patients and healthy controls(n = 19,291 total samples)-to analyze macrophage STING expression and function. Mouse EMS model was generated by injecting uterus fragments into WT or STING-/- mice. Peritoneal fluid was collected and macrophage proportions and subtypes were assessed via flow cytometry. Macrophages were depleted in STING-/- mice prior to EMS induction to evaluate their role in disease progression. In vitro, hemin was used to treat macrophages to investigate how heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) modulates the STING pathway, assessed through immunoblotting, co-immunoprecipitation, ELISA, and multiplex immunofluorescence. Results: Bioinformatic analysis revealed that macrophages within the EMS lesions are primarily derived from peritoneal macrophages and exhibit decreased STING expression, which correlated negatively with HO-1. STING-/- mice developed more numerous and larger EMS lesions, accompanied by a decreased proportion of large peritoneal macrophages and an increase in small peritoneal macrophages. A marked elevation in M2-type macrophages within the lesions was detected in STING-/- mice. In vitro, hemin-induced HO-1 suppressed STING pathway activation in macrophages. Mechanistically, HO-1 inhibited the translocation of STING from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, thereby suppressing STING signaling and facilitating EMS. Conclusion: Macrophages are essential for lesion formation in STING-/- mice. In vitro, hemin promotes EMS progression via HO-1-mediated suppression of the STING pathway.

These channels are modulated by multiple agents and are known binding sites for neuroactive steroids (NAS) including allopregnanolone (AlloP). Using erastin, an agent that promotes VDAC activation by preventing inhibition by tubulin, we assessed the impact of VDAC activation on hippocampal function. Brief erastin administration had no effect on basal transmission but completely inhibited induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the Schaffer collateral pathway of rat hippocampal slices. This LTP inhibition was prevented by VBIT-4, an agent that inhibits VDAC oligomerization. VDAC-mediated LTP inhibition was also prevented by inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1, downstream effectors of VDACs, but not by inhibition of cGAS-STING, narrowing the neuroinflammatory pathways involved. Similarly, effects of erastin were prevented by AlloP and at lower concentrations by its unnatural enantiomer (ent-AlloP), an agent that unlike AlloP has little effect on GABAA receptors. Erastin also inhibited memory formation in a hippocampal-dependent form of one-trial learning and these effects were prevented by VBIT-4 and ent-AlloP, but not by a non-sedating dose of AlloP. These results have relevance for understanding the role of VDACs as mediators of neuronal stress and for the further development of NAS as neurotherapeutics and modulators of cellular stress.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.24.684242v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.4, "ingested_at": "2025-10-26T16:32:32.310384"}

Here, we used overexpression of the two reprogramming factors SOX2 and cMYC to generate iNSC from erythroid progenitors of donors ranging from neonatal to 101 years of age. Using an epigenetic clock algorithm, we corroborated our previous finding that iNSCs generated from aged donors show pronounced epigenetic de-aging, preserving around 13 % and 5 % of the original donor age at low and high passages, respectively. Studying the dynamic of epigenetic de-aging during iNSC conversion across time, we found that this process is largely protracted, continuing for several weeks and even beyond forced neuronal differentiation of iNSCs. Transcriptomic differences between young and old donor-derived iNSCs dissipate with extended time in conversion, too. Concordant with this observation, established iNSC lines lack age-associated cellular hallmarks, similar to induced pluripotent stem cells and their derivatives. Interestingly, time course analysis of DNA methylation and RNA sequencing data revealed that acquisition of a bona fide NSC signature extends greatly beyond the time point when proliferative PAX6-positive iNSCs emerge.

Does retinotopic cortex represent visual information in an allocentric or retinocentric reference frame? Here, we investigate which reference frame the brain uses by dissociating allocentric and retinocentric reference frames via a head tilt manipulation combined with electroencephalography (EEG). Nineteen participants completed between 1728-2880 trials during which they briefly viewed (150 ms) and then remembered (1500 ms) a randomly oriented target grating. In interleaved blocks of trials, the participant's head was either kept upright, or tilted by 45 degee using a custom rotating chinrest. The target orientation could be decoded throughout the trial (using both voltage and alpha-band signals) when training and testing within head-upright blocks, and within head-tilted blocks. Importantly, we directly addressed the question of reference frames via cross-generalized decoding: If target orientations are represented in a retinocentric reference frame, a decoder trained on head-upright trials would predict a 45 degree offset in decoded orientation when tested on head-tilted trials (after all, a vertical building becomes diagonal on the retina after head tilt). Conversely, if target representations are allocentric and anchored to the real world, no such offset should be observed. Our analyses reveal that from the earliest stages of perceptual processing all the way throughout the delay, orientations are represented in between an allocentric and retinocentric reference frame.

S."], "abstract": "Introduction: Endovascular rescue treatment, including intra-arterial spasmolysis and/or transluminal balloon angioplasty, is widely used for symptomatic vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), yet its impact on functional recovery remains uncertain. We systematically reviewed and synthesized evidence on patient-centered outcomes, exploring effects by follow-up time, intervention type, and clinical severity. Materials and methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science (January 2000-December 2024; final update July 2025). Prospective and retrospective studies of adult aSAH patients receiving endovascular treatment for symptomatic angiographic vasospasm were included. Data extraction followed a standardized PICO framework, and study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Because reporting of angiographic resolution and DCI-related infarction was sparse or inconsistent, quantitative synthesis focused on dichotomized favorable functional outcome (e.g., mRS 0-2 or GOS good recovery). Single-arm meta-analyses of proportions were performed on the logit scale using random-effects generalized linear mixed models, with subgrouping by follow-up, intervention, and clinical severity. Results: Thirty-nine studies (1,627 patients; 27 retrospective cohorts, 5 prospective cohorts, 5 case series, 2 randomized trials) met inclusion criteria; 38 contributed to meta-analysis. The pooled proportion of favorable functional outcomes was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.50-0.61) with substantial heterogeneity (I2 {approx} 71%). Prespecified subgroup analyses by follow-up duration, intervention type, and baseline severity did not reveal significant differences. The two randomized trials reported conflicting short-term results with limited follow-up. Safety reporting was variable but generally acceptable for pharmacologic spasmolysis, while higher complication rates were sometimes observed with mechanical interventions. Conclusion: Among patients with symptomatic vasospasm or DCI requiring endovascular rescue, approximately half achieve a favorable functional outcome. However, marked heterogeneity and reliance on largely observational data preclude firm conclusions regarding comparative effectiveness. Standardized multicenter randomized trials with harmonized definitions of eligibility, timing, outcomes, and adverse events are needed to clarify the therapeutic role and optimize patient selection for endovascular rescue after aSAH.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.23.25338701v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-26T16:32:32.428226"}

Despite the global rise of armed conflict, evidence on effective approaches to building social cohesion in conflict-affected contexts is limited. This study evaluates the activities of a women-led community center on social cohesion among Lebanese and Syrian women in Lebanon, a country characterized by multiple displacement crises and deep sectarian divides. Methods: Following an extensive recruitment drive in neighborhoods surrounding the community center, 206 women were randomized into an intervention and control group. The intervention group was invited to participate in seven sessions of training and structured dialogue facilitated by women volunteers at the center. A total of 177 women across the two groups completed both a baseline and endline survey capturing dimensions of social cohesion including trust, belonging and friendship networks, as well as civic engagement, wellbeing and self-efficacy. We present descriptive analysis of participants baseline characteristics, intervention take-up and social cohesion measures. We then conduct an intent-to-treat analysis of the interventions impact using regression models. Results: Among women assigned to the intervention group, 70 (76.1%) attended any of the sessions. The intervention had a positive effect on participants sense of belonging, measured by the social relationship scale, and civic engagement attitudes and behaviors. We did not find effects on generalized trust or the other outcome measures.   Conclusions: This pilot randomized trial demonstrates the potential of community centers to foster aspects of social cohesion in fragile settings as well as the limitations of short, low-intensity contact interventions. The results emphasize the need for further investment in and evaluation of sustained, contextually adapted approaches. The study also shows that randomized evaluations of community-based initiatives are feasible in conflict-affected contexts and can generate valuable evidence to inform peacebuilding efforts.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.23.25338663v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-26T16:32:32.428570"}

To directly assess this, we used a genetic approach to generate pigmented mice deficient for both Abca4 and Cfd, an essential serine protease for alternative pathway initiation and amplification. Complement protein analysis revealed increased total C3 immunolabeling in the RPE and choroid of Cfd-/- mice, while C3d deposition at the RPE basal labyrinth and apical microvilli was markedly reduced, consistent with impaired alternative pathway activity. Western blotting confirmed altered C3 fragment profiles in Cfd-/- backgrounds, supporting a constitutive role for the alternative pathway in RPE complement activation. However, loss of Cfd did not prevent lipofuscin accumulation in the RPE of Abca4-/- mice. Under light-induced stress, we unexpectedly observed a modest attenuation of outer nuclear layer thinning in Abca4-/- that was unchanged by Cfd loss, which independently also showed a comparable rescuing effect. Together, these findings demonstrate that while the alternative pathway is a major driver of complement activation in the RPE and contributes only modestly to photoreceptor degeneration under light stress, its inhibition is insufficient to alter lipofuscin accumulation in pigmented Abca4-/- mice.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.25.684461v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.6500000000000001, "ingested_at": "2025-10-26T16:42:33.021021"}

Bonded social partners (pair-bonded mates and direct kin) engaged in these dyadic events more frequently and coordinated their visits, as shown by shorter dyadic arrival latencies. Bonded partners also showed higher social tolerance, with feeding individuals benefitting from increased food intake when their partner was present, while queuing individuals accepted short-term opportunity costs to remain with them.

Data collected included demographic information such as age, gender, year of study, and DASS-21 scores. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the prevalence and severity of anxiety, depression, and stress. Binary logistic regression models were employed to identify associations between mental health outcomes and demographics. Differences were statistically significant at a level of 5%. Ethics was obtained prior to data collection. Results: Four hundred and seventy-four students from 11 universities participated in this study, aged 17 to 42 years (mean {+/-} SD: 23 {+/-} 3 years). Most participants were females (n=259, 54.6%), not-married (n=446, 94.1%), Christians (n=297, 62.7%), and had no children (n=451, 95.1%).

K., Regan, S."], "abstract": "Background: Deciduous woody perennials, such as hazelnut, undergo winter dormancy to protect sensitive tissues, such as flowers, from harsh conditions. The reproductive success of the tree is dependent on the release of dormancy under favorable conditions. To bloom, the tree must first experience a certain amount of chilling, followed by a certain amount of warmth. With global warming, many trees risk not being able to accumulate enough chilling to release dormancy. Also, when trees accustomed to warm climates are brought into cold climates, they might bloom prematurely at the first sign of spring, and risk freezing damage. The latter is the case for hazelnut, recently adopted as a crop in Ontario, Canada. The present study investigates the hormonal regulation of dormancy in hazelnut male flowers (catkins) by generating hormone profiles in early and late-blooming accessions throughout the dormant season. Abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin (GA), auxin, cytokinin (CTK), their metabolites, as well as the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), were measured. Results: ABA decreased with dormancy progression, while GA increased. This correlation implies ABA is primarily responsible for dormancy maintenance in catkins and GA works antagonistically to ABA. Indeed, the ABA/GA ratio steadily decreased throughout dormancy. For the first time, CTKs have been reported to steadily increase during dormancy. Auxin and ethylene appear to primarily play a role in the onset of dormancy. Interestingly, early blooming accessions failed to accumulate the auxin conjugate, IAA-Asp and had higher ACC levels throughout most of dormancy.

Given that large and small cells differ in their biochemical composition, we hypothesize that they should also differ in how they respond to signals and make decisions. Here, we investigated how cell size affects the susceptibility to cell death. We found that large cells are more resistant to ferroptosis induced by system xc- inhibition. Ferroptosis is a type of cell death characterized by the iron-dependent accumulation of toxic lipid peroxides. This process is opposed by cysteine-dependent lipid peroxide detoxification mechanisms. We found that larger cells exhibit higher concentrations of the cysteine-containing metabolite glutathione and lower concentrations of membrane lipid peroxides, compared to smaller cells. Mechanistically, this can be explained by the fact that larger cells had lower concentrations of an enzyme that enriches cellular membranes with peroxidation-prone polyunsaturated fatty acids, ACSL4, and increased concentrations of the iron-chelating protein ferritin and the glutathione-producing enzymes glutamate-cysteine ligase and glutathione synthetase.

We reveal that, unlike traditional donor-to-recipient delivery, Nanotube-dependent Plasmid exchange (NPex) operates bidirectionally, enabling both plasmid donation and, to a lesser extent, plasmid acquisition. By identifying a Bacillus subtilis natural isolate deficient in NPex, we discovered a prophage-encoded factor, YokF, that blocks plasmid transmission, chiefly acting within the donor cell to inhibit plasmid donation. YokF is a nuclease that localizes to the membrane, where it interacts with a nanotube component to selectively impede plasmid transfer through degradation. Importantly, YokF homologs from various bacterial species were found to exhibit anti-NPex activity. Given their prevalence in Gram-positive bacteria, we propose that YokF homologs represent a conserved family of NPex gatekeepers that restrict plasmid flow within bacterial communities.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.26.684598v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.4, "ingested_at": "2025-10-26T20:22:00.068904"}

A screen of 3,034 FDA-approved compounds identified zinc pyrithione (Zp), bismuth subcitrate (Bis), and polymyxin B (Pol) as lead inhibitors of ExoU selectively inhibiting it without affecting human PLA2s or bacterial viability. The compounds have distinct inhibitory mechanisms: Zp disrupted ExoU oligomerization and protein stability; Bis impaired phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-dependent membrane association; Pol directly inhibited catalysis via its lipid-peptide architecture. Compound combinations enhanced ExoU inhibition in vitro to nanomolar concentrations. In mammalian cells, Bis and Pol promoted lysosomal trafficking and degradation of ExoU. Using a high-throughput microscopy platform, we screened 53 P. aeruginosa keratitis isolates, confirming broad efficacy of these inhibitors in exoU strains. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in ex vivo porcine corneas, Galleria mellonella, and in vivo mouse keratitis models. Topical delivery of ExoU inhibitors, particularly in combination, significantly reduced corneal opacity, ulceration, and stromal damage in porcine corneas without affecting bacterial load. In Galleria, compound combinations significantly maintained larval health, improved larval survival and delayed mortality. In a mouse eye infection model, combinatorial treatment reduced disease severity and preserved tissue viability without altering bacterial burden.

Targeting cell-wall synthesis is a promising approach, as evidenced by the success of broad-spectrum {beta}-lactam antibiotics and the frontline antituberculosis drug isoniazid. However, these agents exhibit limited efficacy against Mabs, often requiring concentrations unachievable in lung tissues. Here, we used a bioluminescence-based whole-cell assay optimized to identify drugs targeting both cell-wall synthesis and the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Screening a small drug library against Mabs revealed multiple hits, including {beta}-lactam antibiotics, validating the effectiveness of this approach to identify cell wall-targeting agents. Among these, we identified a chemically tractable naphthalene scaffold with potent bactericidal activity. The optimized derivative GM47-1 targets MmpL3, disrupting cell wall integrity, inducing ATP leakage into the extracellular milieu, and uncoupling respiration, predominantly through the cytochrome bcc:aa3 branch. Further chemical optimization resulted in a new derivative exhibiting a nanomolar minimum inhibitory concentration, with potent activity against intracellular Mabs and in a zebrafish model of infection.

Here, we refine our understanding of the iad pathway using bacterial genetics, metabolomics, and isotope tracing to assign roles to individual Iad pathway enzymes and show that IadDE, though resembling a Rieske dioxygenase, functions instead as a monooxygenase that initiates catabolism via a novel intermediate. Guided by these insights, we installed chromosomal iad cassettes into root-associated commensals (Polaromonas MF047 and Paraburkholderia MF376), creating the first engineered bacteria that reprogram rhizosphere auxin homeostasis in microbially complex environments to benefit the plant. In natural soil, engineered Paraburkholderia enhanced plant biomass, and community profiling revealed no significant differences in microbiome composition between engineered and wild type treatments, supporting that auxin degradation conferred plant benefit without broader disruption of the rhizosphere community. Together, this work refines the pathway logic of microbial auxin degradation and demonstrates that commensals can be rationally engineered to deliver auxin-balancing functions in complex rhizosphere microbiomes.

Climate change can also reduce the nutritional value of food resources, causing malnutrition, which can lead to impaired immunity and disease vulnerability. However, despite these associations, no experiments have tested how dietary manipulations and temperature variations interact to drive the effects of pathogenic infections. In this work, we conducted laboratory experiments with the model insect Drosophila melanogaster to test these effects. Results: Virgin flies raised on low-carbohydrate diets exhibited improved post-infection survival rates and more resilience to pathogen burden compared to those reared on standard or high-carbohydrate diets. However, such a survival advantage of the low-carbohydrate diet was lost in mated individuals. Notably, temperature stress decreased survival rates in flies only when they were reared on a standard diet. This effect was not observed in flies raised on high- or low-carbohydrate diets, indicating that the impact of temperature on infection responses might depend on diet. Besides, flies developing on a low-carbohydrate diet showed greater fertility at ambient temperatures than those on other diets, indicating an apparent lack of fitness costs associated with improved post-infection response. Also, high-carbohydrate diets conferred greater resistance to starvation, suggesting differences in resource allocation among somatic maintenance tasks that could increase vulnerability to pathogens. Conclusion: Overall, these findings imply a complex interaction between diet, temperature, and fitness traits that influences variation in infection responses.

E."], "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that affects approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States and millions globally. Although curative therapies, such as stem cell transplant and gene therapy, are available, their application is limited by high cost and donor availability. Consequently, drug therapy remains the most feasible treatment option for the majority of patients with SCD. To date, only four drugs have been approved by the FDA, but none of these treatments comprehensively address all SCD-related symptoms or crises, suggesting the pressing need for developing new drugs. Several high-throughput screening campaigns have been performed for SCD drug discovery based on the in vitro sickling of red blood cells (RBCs) and they have identified several hits. However, it is challenging to replicate the organ-specific oxygen level and physiological deoxygenation time in these in vitro RBC sickling assays. Furthermore, these assays do not consider the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of the identified drugs, which are essential to determine whether the drugs can provide robust and sustained efficacy in treated patients with SCD. To address these technical gaps, we have developed a computational platform to perform post-screening analysis of potential anti-sickling agents. This platform sequentially combines PK/PD models with a kinetic model of RBC sickling, enabling efficient prediction of the dosage-dependent therapeutic efficacy of various anti-sickling agents based on patient-specific hematological factors and organ-specific oxygen levels. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of our integrated platform by showcasing the therapeutic efficacy of two FDA-approved drugs, Hydroxyurea (HU) and voxelotor. Next, we evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of two potential anti-sickling agents under clinical trial, namely Bitopertin and osivelotor. Our findings suggest that Bitopertin exhibits anti-sickling effects that are considerably less pronounced than those of HU and voxelotor. On the other hand, osivelotor can achieve similar anti-sickling effects as voxelotor with significantly lower doses due to its improved PK properties. Furthermore, we show the versatility of the proposed platform in predicting the anti-sickling effect of multi-agent therapies and evaluate the consequences of drug noncompliance. In particular, our analysis indicates that noncompliance with voxelotor may result in rapid increases in RBC sickling, whereas osivelotor is likely to mitigate noncompliance-induced adverse effects due to improved PK properties. We further quantify the relationship between drug dosage and the duration of noncompliance that leads to loss of therapeutic efficacy for voxelotor and osivelotor, providing guidance for optimizing dosage strategies to reduce the risk associated with noncompliance. In summary, our in silico platform serves as a valuable tool for post-screening analysis of potential anti-sickling agents by considering their PK and anti-sickling efficacy under patient-specific hemoglobin level and organ-specific oxygen level, thereby gaining insights into their potential therapeutic efficacy alone or in combination before clinical trials.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.25.684554v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.5, "ingested_at": "2025-10-26T20:52:02.045907"}

One of the key strength of the Random Forest approach is its ability to provide feature importance scores, which allows us to interpret which side effects are most influential in predicting drug interactions. The key advantage of Gradient Boosting is its high predictive performance combined with interpretability. It is able to handle complex, structured data efficiently. Additionally, the model's decisions are more transparent, which is necessary in the biomedical domain. The advantageof SVM is its ability to handle high-dimensional data, capture complex non-linear interactions using kernel functions, and generalize with datasets, making it robust to over-fitting. BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining) is advantageous for DDI prediction due to its biomedical domain knowledge, contextual understanding of complex drug-related texts.These method captures the relevance and importance of each side effect of multi drugs and also generate pairs of drugs from the dataset.

Methods: We analyzed 314 multicolor fundus images from 169 patients. Images were preprocessed using an enhanced Retinex algorithm and segmented into three concentric macular zones: Zone 1 (fovea, central 1.5 mm diameter), Zone 2 (parafovea, 1.5-2.5 mm ring), and Zone 3 (perifovea, >2.5 mm radius). A multi-output convolutional neural network (AttCatVgg-Net), based on VGG-16 and enhanced with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), was trained to simultaneously perform three-class cataract classification (normal to mild, moderate, severe) and visual acuity (VA) regression. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, AUC, F1-score, and regression metrics. Statistical analyses included the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Spearman correlation test. Results: For cataract grading, the integrated model using all wavelengths and zones achieved 92.5% accuracy, 94.7% area under the ROC curve (AUC), and a 92.1% F1-score. The green channel alone achieved 90.1% accuracy and 0.93 AUC, while the red channel yielded lower performance (76.3% accuracy, 0.83 AUC). Among anatomical zones, Zone 1 (fovea) and Zone 3 achieved 84.3% and 84.71% accuracy and 0.88 and 0.89 AUC, respectively, whereas Zone 2 underperformed (60.41% accuracy, 0.71 AUC). For visual acuity prediction, the full model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.1181 and a coefficient of determination (R-squared) of 0.7759. The green channel demonstrated the strongest correlation with actual VA (correlation coefficient = 0.823, p < 0.001), followed by green-red (0.817) and blue (0.809). The green channel also achieved the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE = 0.0369) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 0.1920), outperforming other channels.

Spheroids were formed from HepaRG liver cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The inclusion of MSCs prevented spatial segregation of hepatic and endothelial compartments and enabled endothelial network formation. We present two media that are suitable for culturing these spheroids: a serum-reduced medium and a defined serum-free medium containing GibcoTM KnockOut serum replacement. These media supported the long-term maintenance of hepatocytes in a metabolically active, relatively mature state, as well as the persistence of endothelial networks. Endothelial cell identity and organization were confirmed by VE-cadherin and ICAM-2 immunostaining and by transmission electron microscopy, which revealed adherens junctions and luminal morphologies consistent with a capillary-like organization. Spheroid-derived HUVECs established anastomoses with external endothelial channels in microfluidic devices. Moreover, endothelial sprouts emerging from the spheroids formed inter-spheroid connections within permissive hydrogels (fibrin or collagen-methylcellulose), a process that depended on the inter-spheroid distance.

In this study, we report a counterintuitive outcome, demonstrating that silk fibroin inhibits amyloidogenic aggregation of -synuclein protein. Our findings reveal that although the fibrillar aggregation of both proteins - individually and in mixtures - remains affected by environmental factors such as concentration and temperature, silk fibroin significantly alters the rheological behavior of the mixed solutions. Our structural and kinetic analyses reveal that silk modifies the structural transitions and self-assembly dynamics of -synuclein through macromolecular crowding and non-specific interactions that eventually suppressed the amyloidogenic aggregation of the -synuclein. Notably, when nanofibrillar amyloidogenic assemblies are forced to form in the presence of silk, they exhibit a markedly increased susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, a phenomenon not observed with pure -synuclein fibrillar constructs.

Here, we identify a TGF-{beta}1 dependent epithelial program that sustains mucosal tolerance during Spn colonization and demonstrate that IAV co-infection disrupts this pathway through IL-17RA-NF-{kappa}B driven inflammation in the nasopharynx. In a murine colonization model, TGF-{beta}1 blockade enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production and neutrophil recruitment, resulting in inflammation-driven Spn clearance. IAV co-infection suppressed epithelial TGF-{beta}1 signaling, increased TRAF6/NF-{kappa}B activation, and impaired tight junction integrity, leading to Spn dissemination. Mechanistically, IL-17RA signaling contributed to the hyperactivation of the TRAF6/NF-{kappa}B axis. Pharmacologic inhibition of TRAF6 or NF-{kappa}B restored epithelial barrier function and reduced Spn translocation in a human air-liquid interface nasopharyngeal epithelial model.

In this work, we present allosteric ligand/aptamer complexes, coupled to biocatalytic reaction modules composed of enzymes, DNAzymes, or transcription machineries, regulating the catalytic and transient functions of these frameworks. This principle is exemplified by the assembly of ligand/aptamer subunits supramolecular complexes that allosterically stabilize the Mg2+-dependent DNAzyme, allowing its ribonucleobase cleavage activity, promoting the formation of transcription templates that yield RNA products, and modulating the assembly of thrombin aptamer subunits that inhibit thrombin-induced coagulation. Specifically, melamine (Mel)/aptamer subunits complexes allosterically stabilize the assembly of Mg2+-dependent DNAzyme strands for substrate cleavage, the formation of thrombin aptamer subunits that inhibit the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, and the stabilization of a transcription template encoding the Malachite Green (MG) RNA aptamer. Furthermore, coupling an enzyme that depletes the ligand/aptamer complex, which allosterically stabilizes the biocatalytic reaction module, demonstrates the dissipative and transient operation of the catalytic system. This concept is illustrated by the adenosine (Ade)/aptamer subunits supramolecular complex, which stabilizes thrombin aptamer subunits to inhibit thrombin-induced fibrinogenesis, and promotes the formation of an active transcription template for RNA synthesis. In the presence of adenosine deaminase (ADA), Ade is transformed into inosine, which lacks affinity for the aptamer subunits, thereby degrading the Ade/aptamer assemblies and depleting the allosteric complexes. The temporal disassembly of these allosteric stabilizing complexes leads to the transient inhibition of thrombin-induced coagulation or to the transient operation of a transcription machinery.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.26.684577v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.4, "ingested_at": "2025-10-26T21:22:03.855770"}

However, detailed morphological and connectomic analysis revealed no clearly distinct direct and indirect medium spiny neuron subpopulations, and a dominance of the direct and hyperdirect pathway. In addition to previously identified neuron types in Area X, we could distinguish three novel GABAergic neuron types, two of which are major output targets of GPe neurons, leading to novel feedback circuitry within Area X.

Much of AVP's effect on social behavior is mediated by the most widely-expressed AVP receptor in the central nervous system: the vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR). Dense expression of V1aR is found in males and females in the lateral septum (LS), which also receives heavy input from sexually-differentiated populations of AVP cells in the extended amygdala. In order to access and interrogate the structure and function of V1aR cells, we developed and validated a V1aR-Cre knockin mouse line (Avpr1a-P2A-iCre). V1aR-Cre mice did not differ from their Cre-negative littermates in their health, sensorimotor function, anxiety/motivational behavioral responses, or in their V1aR binding levels in the LS. The distribution of Cre in the brain, as assessed by crosses with Cre-reporter mouse lines and in situ hybridization (ISH), was highly similar to patterns of V1aR binding and demonstrated strong colocalization between Cre and V1aR expression within LS cells. We used this V1aR-Cre mouse to identify the inputs and outputs of V1aR+ cells in the LS, via a monosynaptic retrograde rabies virus as well as anterograde synaptophysin-mRuby AAV tracing approaches. Monosynaptic inputs to V1aR LS cells were observed from the medial preoptic area (MPA), lateral hypothalamus (LH), hippocampus (mostly ventral), medial septum, diagonal band of Broca (DBB), and the supramammillary nucleus (SuM). Synaptophysin labeling revealed outputs to some of these same structures (MS, LH, DBB, SuM) as well as parts of the lateral preoptic area (LPO), anterior hypothalamic area (AHA), and ventral pallidum. Notably, most structures (except for hippocampus) bidirectionally connected to V1aR LS cells also contain populations of V1aR+ cells and are targets for BNST/MeA AVP cells, suggesting an integrated AVP/V1aR circuit. Finally, using ISH, we measured levels of V1aR mRNA expression in subregions of the LS and colocalization of V1aR with oxytocin receptor (OTR) mRNA, which also has a high affinity for AVP, within the LS. We found similar high percentages of cells containing V1aR+ puncta across dorsal and intermediate LS in both males and females. In contrast, the ventral LS contained fewer V1aR+ cells in both males and females. The highest level of co-expression of V1aR and OTR was found in the intermediate LS in both sexes, suggesting the possible location of functional interactions between AVP and oxytocin within the LS. We also sought to identify other phenotypic aspects of V1aR cells using ISH and confirmed that all LS V1aR cells are GABAergic and that most also express corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2, suggesting a substrate by which AVP could interact with stress-related systems in the LS. Our characterized V1aR-Cre mouse will be a valuable resource for understanding the role of AVP/V1aR in behavioral and physiological systems.

After three 80-second LIFU stimulations spaced 30 minutes apart, we found that LIFU excited or inhibited NAcc dopamine release for up to 90 minutes, and these effects were dependent on oscillation frequency and sex. In male rats, theta (8 Hz)-coupled beta (16 Hz) LIFU reduced both dopamine release by 58% and the level of the astrocytic marker GFAP by 50%. Similar decreases in dopamine density were observed in females. Delta (2 Hz)-coupled beta (16 Hz) stimulation produced similar inhibitory effects. Conversely, theta (5 Hz)-coupled gamma (50 Hz) LIFU increased dopamine release by 28% in males. However, similar excitation levels were observed only in females with an increased gamma frequency of 70 Hz (coupled with a theta frequency of 7 Hz).

Lhx2 and Lhx9 activate Robo3 while also inducing its repressor, Barhl2. Additionally, negative feedback loops fine-tune the transience of Robo3 expression by adjusting the relative strength of the activation and repression modules.

A., Nilsson, A."], "abstract": "Computational models of cellular networks hold promise to uncover disease mechanisms and guide therapeutic strategies. Biology-informed neural networks (BINNs) is an emerging approach to create such models by combining the predictive power of deep learning with prior knowledge, a vital aspect of biological research. The architectures of BINNs enforces a network structure from which mechanism can ideally be inferred. However, a key challenge is to evaluate the reliability of these mechanisms, as cells are inherently complex, involving intricate and sometimes unknown interactions. Currently, analysis has mainly focused on selected pathways rather than a more comprehensive perspective. In this work we demonstrate an improved, holistic approach: we measure to which extent purposefully introduced spurious interactions are removed by a BINN during training (self-pruning). This metric is scalable and generalizable, as it does not depend on manual curation and so can be translated into diverse network settings. To enable the necessary rapid network-wide testing, we reimplemented LEMBAS (Large-scale knowledge-EMBedded Artificial Signaling-networks), our recurrent neural network framework for intracellular signaling dynamics, with full GPU acceleration. Our implementation achieves a >7-fold speedup compared to the original CPU version while preserving predictive accuracy. We evaluated self-pruning in 3 different datasets and found that when spurious interactions are introduced at random, the model prunes these to a much larger extent than those from the prior knowledge network (PKN), provided that the model is regularized with a sufficiently large L2 norm. This suggests that BINNs are robust to uncertainty in the PKN and is a quantitative sign that they learn real aspects of the modeled systems through training.

While hypocholesterolemia is associated with poor outcomes, the causal role of cholesterol and its underlying mechanisms remains unclear. Objectives: To determine whether elevated plasma cholesterol improves sepsis survival and to elucidate the mechanistic basis of this effect. Methods: We analyzed septic patients from the MIMIC IV database. Total cholesterol levels were compared between 28 day survivors and non-survivors using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the association between cholesterol levels and mortality, adjusting for age, sex, race, SOFA score, and Charlson comorbidity index. To establish causality, C57BL/6J mice were randomized to receive either a high-cholesterol diet (HCD) or regular diet (RD) for three days prior to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to induce sepsis. Measurements and Main Results: Survivors had significantly higher cholesterol levels than non-survivors (median, 135 vs. 126 mg/dL, p < 0.001). High cholesterol ([&ge;] 133 mg/dL) was independently associated with reduced 28-day mortality (adjusted HR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.95, p = 0.012). In mice, HCD elevated plasma cholesterol and significantly improved survival (52.5% to 90%), independent of immune modulation. Hepatic transcriptomics revealed metabolic reprogramming, including upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and glutathione-mediated antioxidant pathways, and suppression of endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis.

Serum PFAS concentrations have been linked to increased type 2 diabetes risk, but whether this is caused by direct effects of PFAS on the endocrine pancreas remains unclear. This study expands on previous biodistribution data to better characterize PFAS accumulation in human pancreas. We also assessed the effects of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) on pancreatic beta cell function using various model systems. Methods We measured concentrations of three legacy PFAS (PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS) in plasma and pancreas from 88 human donors. We also modeled PFOS and PFOA exposure in mice to confirm our human biodistribution data. We next exposed immortalized INS-1 cells, primary human donor islets, and primary mouse islets to DMSO (vehicle) or PFOS (1, 10 or 100 M) either acutely during a glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) assay or for 48h (prolonged) and GSIS was subsequently measured. We also assessed whether the acute effects of PFOS on GSIS in mouse islets were mediated by G-protein coupled receptor-40 (GPR40) and/or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R). Lastly, we exposed female mice to DMSO or 10 mg/kg PFOS with or without a 2 g/kg glucose bolus to assess the acute effects of PFOS on glucose homeostasis in vivo. Results PFOS was detected at higher concentrations in both plasma and pancreas compared to PFOA and PFHxS in our human donor population. Similarly, PFOS accumulated in pancreas at concentrations 2x higher than PFOA in our mouse model. We provide compelling evidence that PFOS exposure dysregulates insulin secretion in various model systems. Prolonged PFOS exposure suppressed GSIS in INS-1 832/3 cells and mouse islets, whereas acute PFOS exposure stimulated GSIS in mouse islets and in a subset of our human donor islets. We also show that the acute effects of PFOS on GSIS in mouse islets were partly mediated by GLP-1R. Importantly, acute PFOS exposure increased plasma insulin levels in female mice in vivo, but only when PFOS exposure was concurrent with a glucose bolus. Conclusions Legacy PFAS chemicals are consistently detected in human pancreas tissue. We clearly show that PFOS exposure dysregulates insulin secretion in various model systems, although effects varied based on the model and duration of exposure.

To resolve this, we developed a closed-loop protocol that analyzes neuronal spiking in real time and adaptively presents new stimuli based on semantic similarity to response-eliciting previous ones. We found that human concept cells show graded responses, following semantic tuning curves. Furthermore, the tuning width and steepness of MTL neurons vary, with the hippocampus exhibiting the steepest tuning. Regional analysis of these tuning curves yields region-specific categorical response profiles (e.g., food responses in the amygdala).

Immature neurons exhibiting migratory features were observed contacting diverse structures in their microenvironment, including the axons, dendrites, synapses, and somas of mature neurons. Surprisingly, these interactions were structurally complex, often involving pronounced deformations of mature somas and the surrounding neuropil.

Traditional emotion research has often assumed that facial expressions reliably reflect internal emotional states and conform to a set of universal expressions. However, emerging evidence suggests that facial expressions are highly individualized and influenced by context. To investigate these factors, we used genetic algorithms to enable participants to generate personalized facial expressions that best matched their subjective interpretation of affect within written contextual scenarios. 12 participants read standardized scenarios drawn from Howard Schatz's Actors Acting, which had been independently rated (0-4) across 13 primary emotions (Amusement, Anger, Awe, Contempt, Disgust, Embarrassment, Fear, Happiness, Interest, Pride, Sadness, Shame, Surprise). Each primary emotion was paired with all 12 secondary emotions that were either maximized (Condition 1) or minimized (Condition 2). Participants completed 26 such randomly interleaved trials, followed by the last condition (Condition 3) in which they selected faces corresponding directly to each of the 13 emotion words. Faces were generated within the 199-dimensional coefficient space of the Basel Face Database, with a genetic algorithm presenting 12 unique faces across 6 generations per scenario. Faces selected by participants as matching a given scenario were semi-randomly combined to generate 6 offspring per generation, with the remaining 6 faces created randomly to maintain genetic diversity. A 4-way ANOVA (factors: affect, context, generation, participant) on the cosine distances among faces revealed a significant main effect of affect (p = .0061) and a significant interaction between affect and context (p = .0003).

Methods: We analyzed 219 saliva samples from 94 participants (aged 9.5-14.5 years) attending 2 to 3 waves of NICAP. DNAm was profiled using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Linear mixed models adjusted for age, sex, medication, batch and cell-proportion assessed longitudinal change.

CVL impacts many aspects of everyday living including subjective reports of deficits in facial expression perception. We quantify the perception of facial affect with a paradigm in which participants created individualized representations of facial expressions using a generative face model and genetic algorithms. 8 patients with CVL ([&ge;]1.3logMAR in better eye) and 8 normally-sighted young controls selected computer-generated faces that manifest each of 13 primary affects (Amusement, Anger, Awe, Contempt, Disgust, Embarrassment, Fear, Happiness, Interest, Pride, Sadness, Shame, and Surprise). An additional group of 8 age-matched normally-sighted controls matched the first four affects. For each affect, 6 generations of 12 faces were generated from the Basel Face database, in which 199 parameters modulate the structure of each face. After the 1st generation, 6 faces were created by combinations of the parameters of faces selected in the previous generation. The remaining r 6 faces were random to introduce genetic variability. A pilot study showed that subjects were most sensitive to changes in the first 20 face parameters, so the analysis was restricted to these. A 2-way ANOVA for the 20 mean coefficients values were compared between the patients and controls. There was a significant (P<.05) main effect for Amusement, Anger, Awe, Disgust, Fear, Interest, and Surprise and a significant (P<.05) interaction for all affects. Overall, coefficient values were closer to 0 for the CVL group, indicating that less extreme face expressions were selected. However, there was no significant difference between groups in the total number of faces selected for each affect besides Fear. This suggests that the tendency towards more neutral faces in CVL patients was not simply a consequence of low sensitivity to affect expression, additionally demonstrating that neither group has a positivity or negativity bias for affective stimuli. These data suggest that CVL patients have significantly different perceptions of facial expressions than age-matched controls. CVL patients have a tendency to choose more neutral looking faces to represent a given affect, whereas the control group chose more extreme, caricatured faces. Elucidating individual differences in emotion representation and recognition has implications for populations including neurotypical, visually impaired, and neurodivergent people.

Nearly-homeostatic systems can be implemented to guarantee performance of a therapeutic device in different patient contexts. Exploration of different near-homeostasis-supporting architectures to satisfy different design requirements is necessary, but methods for doing so in a fast and comprehensive manner remain elusive. We have identified two constrained optimization approaches to find near-homeostasis supporting architectures 10 to 100 times faster than brute-force search. Once such architectures are found, characterizing the underlying mechanisms of near-homeostasis is hindered by the very cumbersome and limited nature of traditional statistical analysis approaches. We have developed two levels of \"inverse homeostasis plots\", and used them to identify two novel near-homeostasis mechanisms that tolerate much higher undesired basal expression and much higher undesired first order degradation rates than previously characterized near-homeostasis mechanisms.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.23.683559v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.45, "ingested_at": "2025-10-27T07:12:34.291948"}

Most digital health studies, however, do not actually measure the effect of tailoring on study outcomes. To address this gap, we created the Success in Tailoring (SIT) scale which assesses how users perceive information as relevant, useful, and actionable. Methods: The SIT items were chosen to reflect theoretical work on relevance and elements of the Elaboration Likelihood Model. It was administered to participants in a study of a mobile app providing tailored information about chronic disease self-management to persons 40 years of age and older with low health literacy. Participants responded immediately after completing the study intervention and again three months later. Psychometric analyses focused on the measures reliability, factor structure, and convergent and divergent validity other measures thought to be related and unrelated to it. We assessed test-retest reliability and factorial invariance over administrations, and whether the measure predicted changes in key study outcomes. Results: Analyses were based on responses from 275 participants. The SITs internal consistency was good, and test-retest reliability was acceptable. Exploratory factor analysis suggested a single- factor solution, although subsequent confirmatory analyses revealed that a bifactor solution with a robust general factor and two minor subfactors fit the data best. The scale was significantly correlated with measures related to its underlying concept and unrelated to measures not related to it, such as physical and cognitive status. Configural and metric, but not scalar, factorial invariance, were confirmed. SIT scores were related to change in activation and disease-management self-efficacy over the course of the study. Confirmatory bifactor analyses supported treating the SIT as essentially unidimensional, with a single total score providing a reliable and valid index of perceived tailoring. Conclusion: The SIT gives researchers a straightforward means of capturing whether participants feel information is successfully tailored to them. It may be helpful in explaining how personalization, a key feature of many digital health apps, may be related to outcomes.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.25.25338794v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-27T07:12:38.734156"}

Trib2 knockout mice exhibit elevated UCP1 expression in brown adipose tissue, leading to enhanced thermogenesis and increased heat production. Mechanistically, TRIB2 acts as a scaffold that binds UCP1 through its pseudokinase domain and recruits the E3 ligase MYCBP2, thereby promoting UCP1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.

Sociocultural barriers including stigma significantly influence women's decisions around screening and treatment. Objective To explore how stigma influences women's experiences with cervical precancer care in the context of emerging self-administered topical therapies. Design A qualitative approach using convenience sampling. Methods Seventeen in-depth interviews were conducted between 2024 and 2025 in Kisumu, Kenya, with women who had been diagnosed with cervical precancer. Participants were recruited to self-administer intravaginal artesunate in a Phase I clinical trial, and interviews explored their experiences. Thematic analysis was conducted using the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework. Results All women discussed experiences indicative of enacted, anticipated, and internalized stigmas related to partner blame, disclosure, and imagining the diagnosis as an imminent death sentence. These stigmas were driven and facilitated by poverty and limited health care access, embarrassment around sexual health, community fears of cervical cancer death, patriarchal norms, and cervical precancer's disproportionate burden on women. Women with cervical precancer feel ''marked'' by medication usage, clinic visits, community expectations of a ''cancer'' appearance, or painful sexual intercourse. By exercising relational autonomy, women in this trial were able to navigate stigmas around sexual health and overcome the debilitating fear of death. They were ultimately able to complete the self-administered artesunate treatment course and initiate conversations in their communities to address stigmas around cervical precancer treatment. Nevertheless, stigmas caused delays to screening and treatment among some participants, while others experienced intimate partner violence or conflict during artesunate treatment. Conclusion Stigmas around cervical precancer, artesunate usage, and abstinence requirements can deeply impact women's social experiences, intimate partnerships, and mental health.

Existing diagnostic frameworks for primary progressive aphasia (PPA) have been developed for English speakers, and have not considered the impact of salient language-specific variations, such as tone. This study investigates lexical tone processing in Mandarin- and Cantonese-speaking individuals with PPA and examines their neural signatures using structural neuroimaging. Methods: Seventy-eight native Chinese speakers (54 with PPA; 24 healthy controls) were assessed using the CLAP (Chinese Language Assessment for PPA) battery, a series of neuropsychological and linguistic tasks developed to characterize the linguistic features of Mandarin and Cantonese speakers with PPA. Lexical tone production was examined through repetition and reading of tone-twister phrases, as well as repetition of multicharacter phrases varying in articulatory features (place, manner, and tone). Tone perception and comprehension was assessed via identification, discrimination, and tone-word/picture matching tasks. Group differences were analyzed using nonparametric tests and generalized estimating equations, with ROC analyses determining diagnostic accuracy. Structural MRI data were acquired for 55 participants, and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to examine the neural correlates of tone performance. Results: Participants with nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA (nfvPPA) showed marked impairments in lexical tone production (all p<0.001), with a disproportionately high rate of tonal relative to syllabic errors (p<0.001). In contrast, semantic variant PPA (svPPA) exhibited prominent deficits in three tone perception tasks (all p<0.001). Patients with logopenic variant PPA (lvPPA) showed relatively preserved tone production but a predominance of syllabic errors (p<0.001), suggesting underlying phonological deficits. Lexical tone production tasks demonstrated strong discrimination of nfvPPA (AUC= 0.702-0.907). In contrast, three tone perception tasks exhibited high sensitivity for detecting svPPA (90.9-100%), though specificity was modest (37-63%). Neural correlate analyses revealed that tone production deficits were associated with reduced grey matter volume in the left inferior frontal gyrus, insula, and temporal cortex, whereas tone perception performance correlated with atrophy in the left superior and middle temporal gyri, temporal pole, and orbitofrontal regions. Discussion: Lexical tone processing is differentially impaired across PPA subtypes, with tone production and perception deficits mapping onto distinct neural substrates. These findings underscore the necessity of developing language-specific diagnostic approaches for tonal language speakers and call into question the cross-cultural applicability of current PPA diagnostic strategies, which have been largely shaped by Indo-European language frameworks.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.24.25338751v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.35, "ingested_at": "2025-10-27T07:32:42.161088"}

We aimed to (1) develop and apply a novel etiological classification system for mechanical circulatory assist device (MCAD)-related strokes, and (2) evaluate the interrater reliability of this classification when applied to cerebrovascular events in LVAD recipients. Methods: The MCAD stroke classification divides LVAD-related strokes in four categories: 1. Management-related (M); 2. Clinically related (C); 3. Acquired (A); 4. Device-related (D). We evaluated the interrater agreement between two independent board-certified vascular neurologists who classified strokes in LVAD patients based on the proposed MCAD classification.

These mutations may also cause the inactivation of FMR1 gene, leading to the FXS phenotypes in individuals with CGG repeat expansions at a normal level (5-44 repeats) or at the premutation level (between 55 and 200 repeats), and not necessarily diagnosed with FXS. Methods: To investigate how widespread the genetic mutations occurring throughout the FMR1 gene locus are, we performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify and synthesize a catalog of disease-causing mutations in the gene that are related to cause FXS or correlated conditions. Results: After a detailed literature analysis, we found 44 single nucleotide variants (SNV) at the locus of the FMR1 gene associated with developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, also including characteristics of FXS. Deletions involving the FMR1 gene that remove several other genes were also found to be associated with FXS phenotype and ovarian problems, besides cases of mosaicisms with deletions and a case of germline mosaicism. Moreover, several of the mutations found, although occurring in distinct parts of FMR1 gene, can alter the aminoacid sequence of FMRP protein. Conclusion: Our critical review presents several non-CGG repeat mutations in FMR1 gene that are directly involved in the phenotypes found in Fragile X Syndrome, indicating that genetic screening for this neurodevelopmental condition should not be restricted to the CGG repeats.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.22.25338597v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-27T07:42:42.708369"}

Cross-reactivity among orthopoxivuses, stemming from high sequence conservation, complicates distinguishing antibody responses from natural MPXV infection versus vaccination or other orthopoxvirus exposures. We validated the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) V-PLEX Orthopoxvirus Panel 1 (IgG) Kit, which quantifies antibody levels to five MPXV antigens and their vaccina virus (VACV) orthologs, following Good Clinical Laboratory Practice (GCLP) guidelines. We assessed assay performance using serum from 26 individuals with prior mpox, 52 JYNNEOS vaccine recipients, and 179 unexposed controls. The assay reliably detected antibody responses in all exposed cohorts with peak levels observed 2-months post-vaccination. Antibody levels to specific antigens also correlated with Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) neutralization titer, particularly for MPXV B6R/VACV B5R, MPXV E8L/VACV D8L, and MPXV M1R/VACV L1. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that some individual antigens achieved high sensitivity and specificity for exposure detection (AUC > 0.96 for VACV D8L, MPXV B6R, VACV B5R); however, individual antigens performed poorly in distinguishing infection from vaccination. In contrast, antibody level ratios between some MPXV and VACV orthologs effectively differentiated MPXV infection from vaccinia vaccination with high sensitivity and specificity (e.g. MPXV A35R/VACV A33R ortholog ratio, AUC = 0.97, sensitivity = 0.97, specificity = 0.96).

D."], "abstract": "Background Older adults have a high burden of pneumococcal disease. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) are effective in reducing disease risk. Recent changes to lower recommended age of pneumococcal vaccination among PCV-naive adults by the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) raises important questions on the optimal age of pneumococcal vaccination, as well as revaccination later in life when immunogenic responses to vaccination declines and disease activity peaks. We aimed to estimate the optimal age(s) and impact of a single dose and two-dose series of pneumococcal vaccination in adults >=50 years-old (y) in the US. Methods and findings Age- and vaccine-serotype-specific IPD cases from the CDCs Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) system among adults >=50y in 2022 were combine with age and race demographic estimates, status of prior PCV use in adult population, vaccine effectiveness (VE), and waning VE dynamics in a cohort model of vaccine impact. Of the 12.8 million ABCs residents aged >=50y, 52.4% were aged >=65y. Black adults in age band 50-64y accounted for 60.2% of the total Black adult population compared to 51.8% of non-Black adults among the total non-Black adult population. A total of 1,557 IPD cases were reported across all ABCs sites; 349 cases in Black (N=1.6 million) and 1,208 cases in non-Black (N=11.2 million) adults. Cases caused by serotypes covered in higher-valency PCV20, PCV21 and PCV31, respectively, accounted for 52.7%, 74.9% and 87.9% of all IPD cases, and these proportions were similar between Black and non-Black adults. The optimal age of a single-dose higher-valency PCV was at 60y or 65y in overall population; earlier at 60y in Black adults compared to 65y in non-Black adults if initial VE was not influenced by age of vaccination. The optimal age shifted to 50y or 60y in overall population; earlier at 50y in Black adults compared to 60y in non-Black adults if initial VE was lower at higher age of vaccination. For maximum impact, a two-dose strategy showed that if the first dose is given at >=65y, the second dose should be given at 5 years after initial dose, and if the first dose is given between 50-64y, the second dose should be given at 10 or 15 years after initial dose, irrespective of VE assumptions or race group. Conclusions Age of vaccination with a single dose of PCV that prevents maximum IPD cases is generally at 60y or 65y, and earlier among underserved populations, reflecting CDCs new changes to lower age of vaccination. Optimal age of vaccination with a second dose of PCV is influenced by the timing of the first dose. Our results are driven by population age structure, age-specific IPD risk, VE dependency on age and waning VE uncertainty. These findings could help inform cost-effective planning and future age- and risk-based PCV recommendations.

Two conventional methods are commonly used to estimate the PAF for enteric infections: the detection-as-etiology (DE) method, which defines the PAF as the pathogen prevalence in diarrheal cases; and the odds-ratio (OR) method, which expresses the PAF as a function of the OR between pathogen detection and diarrhea. A third, less frequently used method uses the risk ratio (RR) to quantify the strength of infection. Methods: We compared each conventional PAF (DE, OR, or RR PAF) to a model-based (MB) PAF, derived from a transmission model of enteric infection, and defined bias as the crude difference from this true MB PAF. We fitted the transmission model to site-specific qPCR data for norovirus and rotavirus detection from MAL-ED (an eight-country birth cohort studying enteric infections) and used the equilibrium states to calculate the MB PAF. Results: For both pathogens, the OR and RR biases were small at all sites (ranging from -5% to +3%), whereas the DE method consistently overestimated the PAF and its bias was the largest of the conventional methods. Conclusions: Our mechanistic model provides an independent alternative to conventional methods, quantifying pathogens-specific enteric burden and the biases in those methods.

Objective To determine whether decreases in overdose mortality between 2023 and 2024 deviate from a previously defined exponential growth curve, and assess how they differ by substance involvement, geography, race/ethnicity, demographic, and other key dimensions. Design, Setting, and Participants Observational study examining overdose deaths in the US between January 1980-December 2024. Mortality trends were compared to an exponential growth curve, fit on data from 1980 to 2016. Exposures Year and month of occurrence of overdose death; substance involvement; census region and division; state; county; race/ethnicity, age, and sex. Main Outcome and Measures Annual or monthly (annualized) overdose deaths per 100,000 population. Results After precipitously surpassing exponential growth predictions in 2020-2023, overdose deaths fell sharply from approximately 32 per 100,000 in 2021-2023 to 23.7 in 2024, below the lower bound of the exponential curve prediction (24.98) for the first time since 2001.

Decreases reflected declining illicit fentanyl-involved deaths (with and without stimulants); however, deaths involving stimulants without fentanyl, and those involving xylazine, continued to increase in 2024. Death rates in the Northeast, South and Midwest fell to 19.5, 19.4 and 17.3 per 100,000, respectively, in December 2024, but remained elevated in the West at 27.2 per 100,000.

Methods: We conducted secondary analyses from the PregnAnZI2 randomised clinical trial, which included data from pregnant women and their offspring who were delivered at eight peripheral health facilities in rural Burkina Faso and two urban health facilities in The Gambia. Logistic regression was used to identify associations between primary outcome (twin deliveries) and both risk factors and adverse outcomes and was informed by a novel conceptual framework. Results: Data from 12,192 newborns born from 11,983 women were analysed. The average twinning rate was 35 per 1000 total births (95% CI: 32 to 39): 27 per 1000 total births (95% CI: 23 to 31) in The Gambia and 45 per 1000 total births (95% CI: 40 to 51) in Burkina Faso.

The United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Rabies Reference Laboratory undertook a large-scale validation of the BioNote Anigen Rapid Rabies Antigen Test in collaboration with eight US public health laboratories and three international laboratories. Modifications were made to manufacturer instructions to maximize antigen concentration in the test diluent. A total of 1,399 samples underwent paired testing with one of three US gold standard tests, consisting of 31 types of animals and 9 rabies virus variants. Test sensitivity and specificity was 97.1% (CI: 95.2% - 98.3%) and 99.9% (CI: 99.4% - 100.0%). Fourteen samples resulted in false-negative results, primarily impacting dogs that were euthanized early or shown to have a low viral load. Limit of detection studies found that false-negative results often occurred when the sample had a PCR Ct value >23. The BioNote Anigen Test performed well across diverse RVVs found in North America. Sensitivity of the test was slightly lower than, but not statistically inferior to, the minimum 98% value established for the current gold-standard tests. This is the largest systematic evaluation of a rabies point-of-care test that includes diverse RVV and animal type and results suggest that the BioNote Anigen Test with the procedural changes would have broad benefits for rapid diagnosis in animals.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.25.25338785v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-27T08:12:44.895671"}

Design: Cross-sectional analysis using recent 2023, nationally representative Demographic and Health survey data from Tajikistan. Setting: National population based study across all regions of Tajikistan (urban and rural areas) using two stage stratified cluster sampling. Participants: 2,355 children in age group 0-59 months with complete data on hemoglobin levels and dietary intake in the preceding 24 hours residing in households selected from 2023 Tajikistan Demographic and Health Survey were included in this study. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome, childhood anemia status (hemoglobin <10.5g/dl for 6-23 months, <11g/dl for 24-59 months, altitude-adjusted per WHO 2024 criteria). Results: Among Tajik children under 5 years, 36.1% of children consumed no vegetables or fruits in the preceding 24 hours and the prevalence of anemia was 33.2%. Adjusted odds in our study revealed no association of ZVF consumption with anemia (OR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.63 to 1.14). Significant associations emerged for maternal anemia which increased child anemia odds by 48% (OR=1.48, 95% CI: 1.16 to 1.88), richest index had 60% lower anemia odds compared to the poorest (OR=0.39, 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.56) and low birth size increased anemia risk two fold (OR=1.92, 95% CI: 1.31 to 2.81).Each additional daily meal consumption reduced anemia odds by 14% (OR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.76 to 0.98). Conclusions: Child anemia in Tajikistan is not primarily driven by specific dietary factors but maternal nutritional status during pregnancy, birth outcomes, and socioeconomic disparities are main drivers. This novel null finding on ZVF intake, underscores that non dietary drivers predominate, informing targeted interventions aligned with SDG2 (Zero hunger).

Blinded physician panels rated responses using a 5-point Likert scale on an 11-domain rubric covering accuracy, safety, contextual appropriateness, and communication. We summarized mean scores and used Bayesian ordinal logistic regression to estimate probabilities of high-quality ratings ([&ge;]4) and to perform pairwise comparisons between LLMs and clinicians. Findings: Clinician mean ratings were lower than those for LLMs in 9/11 domains: 2.86 vs 4.25-4.72 (guideline alignment), 2.76 vs 4.25-4.73 (expert knowledge), 2.96 vs 4.30-4.73 (logical coherence), and 2.58 vs 4.16-4.68 (low omission of critical information). On safety-related domains, LLMs received higher ratings: minimal extent of possible harm 3.16 vs 4.29-4.68; low likelihood of harm 3.68 vs 4.54-4.81.

M., Dharmalingam, G., Collier, D., Lewis, C., Dunham, J. P., Pickering, A. E., Kless, A."], "abstract": "Introduction: In this population-based genetic study of chronic pain, we performed association analysis, including rare variants analysis, across a broad spectrum of conditions. While it is well-established that genetic factors play a significant role in the susceptibility to chronic pain, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted to date have only uncovered a small portion of the genetic variants that likely contribute to its heritability. Our study identified shared genetic contributors to pain conditions at variant and gene levels, on a genome-wide basis. Methods: We performed genome wide association analysis of chronic pain using the whole exome sequencing data in the UK Biobank across chronic pain conditions using optimized control cohorts. 355 chronic pain endpoints were derived from ICD diagnoses and a pain-specific questionnaire. For that purpose, we recalibrated principal components to account for population stratification and designed control cohorts to minimize bias and variability in the identified associations. Additionally, we analyzed the shared genetic heritability of these different pain conditions using latent causal variable analysis on genotypic array data. Finally, we compared genes from our genome-wide significant associations with prior reported pain relevant genes. Results: We found novel associations for mutations in all investigated pain conditions, with a particular emphasis on rare variants in the full UK Biobank cohort, which opens new opportunities for therapeutic approaches in the age of genetic medicines. Consequently, novel mechanisms of enigmatic diseases like complex regional pain syndrome and Fibromyalgia can be proposed. Many of these associations revealed the relevance of auto-immune processes and vascular pathophysiology. For example, in complex regional pain syndrome we found several novel genome wide significant associations. Examples include a causal rare missense variant in sialic acetyl esterase (SIAE R479C, p-value 3.34E-08, odds ratio 7.1, MAF 1e-04) and a protective rare missense variant in Mammary Analogous Zinc Finger 2 (MAML2, p-value 6.57E-06, odds ratio 0.62, MAF 0.015, I480M, rs61749251), which acts as a transcriptional cofactor for Notch proteins. We conducted epistasis analyses on top-ranking variants to assess mutation penetrance and identified a causal mutation in JCAD (V366E, beta = = 3.4, Chi2 = 20.4, OR = 29.9, p = 6.39E-06), a gene previously implicated in coronary artery disease. Given JCADs role in endothelial cell junctions and vascular integrity, this mutation may also influence neurovascular contributions to pain signaling, particularly in chronic inflammatory states. Importantly, we discovered a rare protective variant in PLA2G7 (S388P, beta = -2.1, OR = 0.12, Chi2 = 12.9, p = 3.16E-04), encoding lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, which is involved in phospholipid catabolism during inflammation and oxidative stress. This variant appears to limit oxylipin accumulation in the vascular wall, a mechanism that may reduce neuroinflammation and peripheral sensitization, offering a protective effect against pain pathophysiology. The use of several control groups of different sizes allowed us to analyze the variability of results depending on this control cohort composition to characterize the sensitivity of genetic associations. This revealed several novel genome wide significant associations that were formerly of lower significance in osteoarthritis. Within our dataset of associations, we found frequently occurring variants that were associated with multiple chronic pain phenotypes suggesting common mechanisms across different pain conditions. Finally, we highlight the identification of novel mutations in known pain genes especially in sodium, potassium and calcium channels. Conclusions: This study provides valuable insights into the genetic architecture of pain conditions by leveraging rare variant analysis and using optimized controls in a large-scale population cohort. Our findings implicate novel genetic associations and their role in pain susceptibility, paving the way for targeted research in the understanding of chronic pain conditions.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.25.25338777v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-27T08:32:46.201266"}

The envelope following response (EFR) has potential as a diagnostic indicator of deafferentation. However, it is not clear what constitutes an abnormal EFR response. The objectives of this study were to establish normative ranges for EFR magnitude in a population at low risk for cochlear synaptopathy and then compare EFRs from a population at high risk for synaptopathy to those normative ranges. Methods: The low-risk sample consisted of young adults with normal audiograms, minimal reported lifetime noise exposure, and no auditory complaints. Normative ranges were generated using rectangular amplitude modulated (RAM) or sinusoidal amplitude modulated (SAM) EFR stimuli and were adjusted for sex and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) levels. The high-risk sample consisted of military Veterans with normal audiograms who reported at least one auditory complaint (tinnitus, decreased sound tolerance, or speech-in-noise difficulty). Results: The SAM EFR normative ranges for a 4 kHz carrier resulted in the biggest separation of the low- and high-risk samples, with 36% of Veterans falling below the lower bound of the normative range. There were no consistent effects of DPOAE adjustment on the normative ranges across sex and stimulus condition and computational modeling suggests that adjusting for DPOAEs may not be necessary in individuals with normal audiograms. Conclusion: EFR normative ranges for the 4 kHz SAM EFR will allow for clinical identification of patients with normal audiograms who have significant degrees of cochlear deafferentation.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.24.25338742v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-27T08:32:46.203209"}

We performed CSF proteomics using tandem-mass-tag mass spectrometry in 1,104 ADNI participants with extensive longitudinal assessments. Machine learning-derived protein panels accurately predicted two classes of outcomes. First, they identified several key inflection points along the disease trajectory, including onset of 1) amyloid plaque pathology (A{beta} - to A{beta} +; AUC=0.88), 2) symptoms (asymptomatic to symptomatic; AUC=0.89), and 3) functional decline (MCI [due-to-AD] to AD Dementia; AUC=0.88). Second, protein panels forecast longitudinal trajectories of decline, spanning both clinical domains (cognition and function) and pathological process, including tau accumulation measured by tau-PET neocortical standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and neurodegeneration indexed by hippocampal volume and FDG-PET SUVR.

Importantly, these predictions were driven by novel mechanisms, spanning synaptic signaling, proteostasis, metabolic stress, vascular remodeling, and immune dysregulation, that anchor distinct inflection points and shape long-term trajectories.

This study assesses whether depressive and anxious moods and suicidal ideation, rapidly screened indicators of these distresses, relate to toothbrushing frequency and dental attendance among a sample of Iranian adults. Methods: This cross sectional study used data from the Integrated and Repeated Public Health Surveillance project (May to September 2023) in southern Tehran Province, Iran. Stratified random sampling was used to survey adults aged 18 and above via telephone. A validated questionnaire assessed depressive mood, anxious mood, suicidal ideation, toothbrushing frequency, and 6 month dental attendance. A composite mental distress variable was also created by combining the three mental distresses. Binary logistic regression analyzed associations, adjusting for covariates. Results: Among the 1,282 participants (mean age 40.1, SD = 13.3, 60.6% female), 23.5% toothbrushed twice a day and above, and 33.2% attended dental visits in the past 6 months. Moderate and high depressive mood levels, higher depressive mood scores, and higher anxious mood scores were all related to toothbrushing less than twice daily (AOR = 0.65, p = 0.004, AOR= 0.54, p = 0.037, AOR = 0.85, p = 0.006, and AOR = 0.87, p = 0.021, respectively).

Conclusions: To address findings, oral healthcare providers should be trained in rapid mental health screening, provide toothbrushing support for those screened, and refer them to mental healthcare when necessary.

Methods: This descriptive cohort study is a secondary analysis of data collected in the framework of a randomised clinical trial, conducted between 2017 and 2021 in The Gambia and Burkina Faso. Pregnant women considered to be low-risk for intrapartum complications and their offspring were enrolled during labour at ten primary and secondary health facilities in The Gambia and Burkina Faso.

Methods: This cross sectional study used data from the Integrated and Repeated Public Health Surveillance project (May to September 2023) in southern Tehran Province, Iran. Stratified random sampling was used to survey adults aged 18 and above via telephone. A validated questionnaire assessed depressive mood, anxious mood, suicidal ideation, toothbrushing frequency, and 6 month dental attendance. A composite mental distress variable was also created by combining the three mental distresses. Binary logistic regression analyzed associations, adjusting for covariates. Results: Among the 1,282 participants (mean age 40.1, SD = 13.3, 60.6% female), 23.5% toothbrushed twice a day and above, and 33.2% attended dental visits in the past 6 months. Moderate and high depressive mood levels, higher depressive mood scores, and higher anxious mood scores were all related to toothbrushing less than twice daily (AOR = 0.65, p = 0.004, AOR= 0.54, p = 0.037, AOR = 0.85, p = 0.006, and AOR = 0.87, p = 0.021, respectively).

None of the mental distress indicators were associated with 6 month dental attendance. Conclusions: To address findings, oral healthcare providers should be trained in rapid mental health screening, provide toothbrushing support for those screened, and refer them to mental healthcare when necessary.

M., Dharmalingam, G., Collier, D., Lewis, C., Dunham, J. P., Pickering, A. E., Kless, A."], "abstract": "Introduction: In this population-based genetic study of chronic pain, we performed association analysis, including rare variants analysis, across a broad spectrum of conditions. While it is well-established that genetic factors play a significant role in the susceptibility to chronic pain, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted to date have only uncovered a small portion of the genetic variants that likely contribute to its heritability. Our study identified shared genetic contributors to pain conditions at variant and gene levels, on a genome-wide basis. Methods: We performed genome wide association analysis of chronic pain using the whole exome sequencing data in the UK Biobank across chronic pain conditions using optimized control cohorts. 355 chronic pain endpoints were derived from ICD diagnoses and a pain-specific questionnaire. For that purpose, we recalibrated principal components to account for population stratification and designed control cohorts to minimize bias and variability in the identified associations. Additionally, we analyzed the shared genetic heritability of these different pain conditions using latent causal variable analysis on genotypic array data. Finally, we compared genes from our genome-wide significant associations with prior reported pain relevant genes. Results: We found novel associations for mutations in all investigated pain conditions, with a particular emphasis on rare variants in the full UK Biobank cohort, which opens new opportunities for therapeutic approaches in the age of genetic medicines. Consequently, novel mechanisms of enigmatic diseases like complex regional pain syndrome and Fibromyalgia can be proposed. Many of these associations revealed the relevance of auto-immune processes and vascular pathophysiology. For example, in complex regional pain syndrome we found several novel genome wide significant associations. Examples include a causal rare missense variant in sialic acetyl esterase (SIAE R479C, p-value 3.34E-08, odds ratio 7.1, MAF 1e-04) and a protective rare missense variant in Mammary Analogous Zinc Finger 2 (MAML2, p-value 6.57E-06, odds ratio 0.62, MAF 0.015, I480M, rs61749251), which acts as a transcriptional cofactor for Notch proteins. We conducted epistasis analyses on top-ranking variants to assess mutation penetrance and identified a causal mutation in JCAD (V366E, beta = = 3.4, Chi2 = 20.4, OR = 29.9, p = 6.39E-06), a gene previously implicated in coronary artery disease. Given JCADs role in endothelial cell junctions and vascular integrity, this mutation may also influence neurovascular contributions to pain signaling, particularly in chronic inflammatory states. Importantly, we discovered a rare protective variant in PLA2G7 (S388P, beta = -2.1, OR = 0.12, Chi2 = 12.9, p = 3.16E-04), encoding lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, which is involved in phospholipid catabolism during inflammation and oxidative stress. This variant appears to limit oxylipin accumulation in the vascular wall, a mechanism that may reduce neuroinflammation and peripheral sensitization, offering a protective effect against pain pathophysiology. The use of several control groups of different sizes allowed us to analyze the variability of results depending on this control cohort composition to characterize the sensitivity of genetic associations. This revealed several novel genome wide significant associations that were formerly of lower significance in osteoarthritis. Within our dataset of associations, we found frequently occurring variants that were associated with multiple chronic pain phenotypes suggesting common mechanisms across different pain conditions. Finally, we highlight the identification of novel mutations in known pain genes especially in sodium, potassium and calcium channels. Conclusions: This study provides valuable insights into the genetic architecture of pain conditions by leveraging rare variant analysis and using optimized controls in a large-scale population cohort. Our findings implicate novel genetic associations and their role in pain susceptibility, paving the way for targeted research in the understanding of chronic pain conditions.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.25.25338777v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-28T13:57:19.745510"}

The envelope following response (EFR) has potential as a diagnostic indicator of deafferentation. However, it is not clear what constitutes an abnormal EFR response. The objectives of this study were to establish normative ranges for EFR magnitude in a population at low risk for cochlear synaptopathy and then compare EFRs from a population at high risk for synaptopathy to those normative ranges. Methods: The low-risk sample consisted of young adults with normal audiograms, minimal reported lifetime noise exposure, and no auditory complaints. Normative ranges were generated using rectangular amplitude modulated (RAM) or sinusoidal amplitude modulated (SAM) EFR stimuli and were adjusted for sex and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) levels. The high-risk sample consisted of military Veterans with normal audiograms who reported at least one auditory complaint (tinnitus, decreased sound tolerance, or speech-in-noise difficulty). Results: The SAM EFR normative ranges for a 4 kHz carrier resulted in the biggest separation of the low- and high-risk samples, with 36% of Veterans falling below the lower bound of the normative range. There were no consistent effects of DPOAE adjustment on the normative ranges across sex and stimulus condition and computational modeling suggests that adjusting for DPOAEs may not be necessary in individuals with normal audiograms. Conclusion: EFR normative ranges for the 4 kHz SAM EFR will allow for clinical identification of patients with normal audiograms who have significant degrees of cochlear deafferentation.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.24.25338742v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-28T13:57:19.745694"}

We performed CSF proteomics using tandem-mass-tag mass spectrometry in 1,104 ADNI participants with extensive longitudinal assessments. Machine learning-derived protein panels accurately predicted two classes of outcomes. First, they identified several key inflection points along the disease trajectory, including onset of 1) amyloid plaque pathology (A{beta} - to A{beta} +; AUC=0.88), 2) symptoms (asymptomatic to symptomatic; AUC=0.89), and 3) functional decline (MCI [due-to-AD] to AD Dementia; AUC=0.88). Second, protein panels forecast longitudinal trajectories of decline, spanning both clinical domains (cognition and function) and pathological process, including tau accumulation measured by tau-PET neocortical standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and neurodegeneration indexed by hippocampal volume and FDG-PET SUVR. Proteomics panels outperformed conventional CSF- and PET-based A{beta} and tau markers. Importantly, these predictions were driven by novel mechanisms, spanning synaptic signaling, proteostasis, metabolic stress, vascular remodeling, and immune dysregulation, that anchor distinct inflection points and shape long-term trajectories.

Design: Cross-sectional analysis using recent 2023, nationally representative Demographic and Health survey data from Tajikistan. Setting: National population based study across all regions of Tajikistan (urban and rural areas) using two stage stratified cluster sampling. Participants: 2,355 children in age group 0-59 months with complete data on hemoglobin levels and dietary intake in the preceding 24 hours residing in households selected from 2023 Tajikistan Demographic and Health Survey were included in this study. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome, childhood anemia status (hemoglobin <10.5g/dl for 6-23 months, <11g/dl for 24-59 months, altitude-adjusted per WHO 2024 criteria). Results: Among Tajik children under 5 years, 36.1% of children consumed no vegetables or fruits in the preceding 24 hours and the prevalence of anemia was 33.2%. Adjusted odds in our study revealed no association of ZVF consumption with anemia (OR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.63 to 1.14). Significant associations emerged for maternal anemia which increased child anemia odds by 48% (OR=1.48, 95% CI: 1.16 to 1.88), richest index had 60% lower anemia odds compared to the poorest (OR=0.39, 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.56) and low birth size increased anemia risk two fold (OR=1.92, 95% CI: 1.31 to 2.81).Each additional daily meal consumption reduced anemia odds by 14% (OR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.76 to 0.98). Conclusions: Child anemia in Tajikistan is not primarily driven by specific dietary factors but maternal nutritional status during pregnancy, birth outcomes, and socioeconomic disparities are main drivers.

Methods: We benchmarked five LLMs (GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5-Flash, DeepSeek-R1, MedGemma, and o3) against Kenyan clinicians, using a randomly subsampled dataset of 507 vignettes (from a larger pool of 5,107 clinical scenarios) spanning 12 nursing competency categories. Blinded physician panels rated responses using a 5-point Likert scale on an 11-domain rubric covering accuracy, safety, contextual appropriateness, and communication. We summarized mean scores and used Bayesian ordinal logistic regression to estimate probabilities of high-quality ratings ([&ge;]4) and to perform pairwise comparisons between LLMs and clinicians. Findings: Clinician mean ratings were lower than those for LLMs in 9/11 domains: 2.86 vs 4.25-4.72 (guideline alignment), 2.76 vs 4.25-4.73 (expert knowledge), 2.96 vs 4.30-4.73 (logical coherence), and 2.58 vs 4.16-4.68 (low omission of critical information). On safety-related domains, LLMs received higher ratings: minimal extent of possible harm 3.16 vs 4.29-4.68; low likelihood of harm 3.68 vs 4.54-4.81. Performance was similar for low inclusion of irrelevant content (4.28 vs 4.25-4.35) and for avoidance of demographic bias (4.86 vs 4.91-4.94).

Although plantar flexor fatigue is believed to be responsible for the proximal shift in mechanical work generation, this has yet to be confirmed experimentally. Purpose: To 1) determine the effect of plantar flexor fatigue on lower limb positive joint work during running and 2) determine the effect of running shoes on this relationship. Methods: Trained male runners (n = 12) were analyzed over two 30 s runs at their 10 km race pace, without and with local plantar flexor fatigue induced via a calf-raise protocol to a level commensurate with that accumulated over an exhaustive run (~24% reduction in peak torque). Both the unfatigued and fatigued runs were performed in a traditional shoe and in advanced footwear technology on an instrumented treadmill while three-dimensional motion capture and ground reaction force data were collected. Results: Plantar flexor fatigue led to a redistribution of joint work, with lower positive ankle work (p < 0.001), greater positive knee work (p = 0.001), and similar positive hip work (p = 0. 550) in the fatigued run as compared to the unfatigued run. The relative positive joint contributions shifted proximally with fatigue (ankle -4%, knee +3%); however, this shift was not influenced by shoe condition (p > 0.05).

Most known two-component lantibiotics are made up of a structurally conserved -lanthipeptide that binds to the peptidoglycan precursor lipid II and a {beta}-lanthipeptide that interacts with the -peptide-lipid II complex to disrupt the membrane of susceptible bacteria. A few two-component lantibiotics including roseocin produced by Streptomycetes do not follow this general scheme and act by different, currently unresolved mechanisms. An important first step in studying this latter group of lanthipeptides is determination of their chemical structure. Roseocin's {beta}-peptide (Ros{beta}) is formed by the RosM lanthipeptide synthetase from the RosA1 precursor peptide. RosM carries out nine dehydrations of Ser and Thr residues to the corresponding dehydroamino acids followed by six Michael-type additions of the thiols of Cys residues to a subset of the dehydroamino acids to form six thioether crosslinks. Sequence alignment with other structurally characterized lanthipeptides does not allow prediction of the ring pattern of Ros{beta}. In this study, Ros{beta} was produced in Escherichia coli and its ring pattern was established by multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy.

Our results show that when two partners are present, they compete, reducing each other's effects, suggesting that interactions tend to be limited to two interacting partners at any given time. In particular, when a distant transgenic copy of an eve insulator (homie or nhomie) is present, it can interact with either endogenous insulator. But when one endogenous insulator is removed, the remaining one interacts more strongly with the transgenic copy, biasing the induced enhancer-promoter interactions toward those nearest the remaining endogenous insulator.

Here, we combine a synchronized cargo-release assay with a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen to systematically map regulators of GPCR ER-to-PM transport. Focusing on the {delta}-opioid receptor (DOR), a prototypical class A GPCR, we identify CNIH1 as a dedicated export factor. In the absence of CNIH1, DOR is retained intracellularly with immature glycosylation, and drives reduced PM signaling. CNIH1 localizes to both ER exit sites and the Golgi, promoting the anterograde transport of a subset of class A GPCRs. Opioid receptors directly interact with CNIH1 and require its putative COPII-binding site for export. Distinct from other human cornichon homologs, CNIH1 defines a selective GPCR-sorting receptor that couples GPCR biosynthesis to signaling competence.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.27.684930v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.45, "ingested_at": "2025-10-28T13:57:20.082800"}

The functions of this broad targeting remain unclear. Here, we uncovered a surprising role for the piRNA pathway in regulating the splicing and fidelity of nascent mRNAs induced during stress. Upon heat shock, piRNAs target essential heat-shock protein (hsp) RNAs, normally absent but massively upregulated upon stress, and generate abundant sequence-specific secondary RNAs (22G-RNAs) antisense to these transcripts. Instead of enforcing silencing, these 22G-RNAs associate with nascent hsp transcripts and RNA polymerase II at the transcription complex, delaying splicing and preserving a pool of pre-mRNAs for processing during recovery from stress. This role of the piRNA pathway in enforcing splicing delays, extends beyond hsps to alternatively spliced genes and ensures the proper expression of long-intron-containing genes in the genome. In piRNA-deficient prde-1 mutants, splicing is precocious, hsp pre-mRNAs are depleted, expression of long-genes is impaired, transcripts accumulate errors, and consequently, embryos become critically dependent on nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) for survival. Downregulating NMD components in piRNA-deficient animals results in the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and embryonic lethality. Thus, by safeguarding splicing under stress, the piRNA pathway complements NMD as a mechanism of RNA quality control, linking RNA fidelity to genome surveillance.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.27.684940v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.45, "ingested_at": "2025-10-28T13:57:20.083044"}

However, sex differences in thyroid disease risk varies with age, e.g. although the risk of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), the most aggressive form of thyroid cancer, increases with age for both sexes, age of diagnosis for most thyroid cancers is lower for females than males. In contrast, the risk of Hashimotos thyroiditis (HT), an autoimmune condition, is higher in ages 30-50 than older age groups, and females have a higher risk than males at any given age. These age- and sex-dependent variations suggest that thyroid aging is a sex-biased process, where gene regulatory patterns evolve with age differentially between sexes. Yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. To characterize sex-specific aging-related changes in gene regulation in healthy thyroid and disease, we constructed individual-specific gene regulatory networks using a two-step approach. First, we estimated gene-gene co-expression networks for each individual using BONOBO. Second, we integrated these networks with sex-specific transcription factor (TF) motif data and protein-protein interaction priors using PANDA to infer individual-level TF-driven gene regulatory networks. We found that within normal thyroid, regulatory patterns of cancer-related genes and biological pathways involved in cell proliferation, immune response, and metabolic processes vary by age in a nonlinear manner. However, the direction and rate of age-related changes differ between sexes. In females we detect two inflection points around ages 40 and 60, when the gene regulatory patterns in healthy thyroid show significant change for most pathways. This drastic change in gene regulatory networks is mostly driven by estrogen and androgen receptor TFs. To understand how aging-related changes in gene regulation drive risk of thyroid disorders, we investigated two diseases that have known sex- and age- specific differences: HT and ATC. We observed that in ATC, disease-relevant immune and metabolic pathways change with age in the same direction as they change in disease. In contrast, in HT, disease-related pathway targeting patterns are in the opposite direction of those in aging. Moreover, in age groups where HT is most diagnosed, TF-targeting patterns of disease-associated immune, metabolic and cell proliferation pathways in females were closer towards the disease state than in males, emphasizing the influence of sex-biased regulatory patterns in increasing thyroid disease risk in females. In thyroid tissue, genes related to immune response and metabolic processes, are regulated by TFs in an age- and sex-biased manner. These age- and sex-specific gene regulatory variations may contribute to the variation in risk of thyroid conditions with age and an overall higher risk of diseases in females compared to males, thus emphasizing the need for tailored screening and prevention strategies.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.27.684890v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.45, "ingested_at": "2025-10-28T13:57:20.084642"}

Existing technology platforms remain inaccessible for research due to restricted access to commercial organ perfusion devices, high costs of both devices and proprietary consumables, and steep technical learning curves. Additionally, the available technology is not optimized to perfuse smaller organs such as the kidney. Methods: To overcome these barriers, a custom NEVOP circuit was developed using recycled, repurposed, and low-cost components. Porcine kidneys and autologous blood were used to iteratively optimize circuit design. A porcine kidney autotransplantation protocol was adapted to evaluate in vivo kidney function after ex vivo perfusion. To pilot the flexibility of this system as a multi-organ platform for ex vivo human biology, non-transplantable human donor kidney, spleen, and pancreas specimens were stably perfused using human blood products and analyzed. Results: An ultra low-cost NEVOP system engineered to perfuse porcine kidneys and diverse human organs (kidney, pancreas, and spleen) sustained viable organs for up to 24 hours with evidence of both function and viability. Key innovations included a parallel flow resistor to facilitate low-flow perfusion in non-heparinized organs and a containment bag with adjustable magnets to provide vascular stability and recycling of venous overflow. The circuit costs less than 1,500USD to construct, and porcine kidneys perfused for 24 hours on this platform demonstrated healthy in vivo function upon autotransplantation.

S., Rokstad, H., Velazquez, J., Browne, S., Edwards, A. G., Kravets, V."], "abstract": "Pancreatic beta cells regulate circulating glucose levels by releasing insulin. Beta cells transduce elevated blood glucose into electrical activity through an intrinsic cascade of metabolic and electrophysiologic responses. These responses are synchronized across the electrically connected network of beta cells, such that insulin release is also relatively synchronous. Despite their coordinated behavior, individual beta cells exhibit significant functional heterogeneity. This heterogeneity is thought to provide cells with specific functional phenotypes the ability to control the activity of the broader network. Hub cells, identified by their synchronized [Ca2+] activity, are one such functional subpopulation, and are believed to orchestrate the second, oscillatory phase of insulin release. However, it remains unclear whether the cell-autonomous characteristics of hub cells, such as their metabolic activity and electrophysiologic properties, are more important than their network characteristics (i.e. gap junctional coupling) for their ability to influence broader network activity. In this study, we investigate the roles of intrinsic metabolic and electrophysiologic properties and ionic coupling in determining the beta hub cell phenotype. Using a computational islet model of 1,000 beta cells, our analysis revealed that both intrinsic metabolic properties and structural coupling via gap junctions are crucial for determining the hub cell phenotype. After investigating the intrinsic coupling conductance of neighboring cells and the number of structural (direct electrical) links as independent contributors to the hub cell's local electrical coupling, we find that the number of cells to which a beta cell is directly coupled may be a key determinant of its propensity to serve as a hub cell in the model. As predicted for this subpopulation, we also demonstrate that decoupling hub cells impairs the functional connectivity of the entire network. Our findings indicate the importance of both autonomous cellular dynamics and non-autonomous structural coupling for the hub cell phenotype.

Traits typically associated with better health - lower trait values of cardiometabolic traits (BMI, HOMA-IR, normal glucose tolerance vs. type 2 diabetes, fasting plasma glucose) and higher physical activity levels (total and vigorous) - were associated with higher expression of energy metabolism genes, and lower expression of signaling pathway genes across muscle fiber types, total pseudobulk, and to some extent in bulk tissue.

Some of these branches are formed during initial outgrowth and often occur via bifurcation of the growth cones of the extending neuronal processes. However, others are formed de novo by branch extension from a previously existing neurite. This process is often referred to as collateral branching. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. We show that in C. elegans, collateral branching of the PLM neuron is mediated by an actin assembly process guided by T ransducer of CDC-42-Dependent Actin assembly-1 (TOCA-1). This scaffolding protein is recruited to the branching site at the time of branch formation. cdc-42 and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor dock-11 are also required for branch formation. Biochemically, TOCA-1 has been demonstrated to recruit WASP-1 and activate the Arp2/3 complex to promote actin assembly. In vivo, both wsp-1 and the Arp2/3 complex mutants also disrupt branch formation. While loss of TOCA-1 disrupts branching, it does not influence anterior-posterior (AP) or dorsal-ventral (DV) positioning of the branch, in contrast to previously defined branching regulators. Our data support a model in which TOCA-1 acts downstream of AP and DV positioning factors, directly orchestrating filopodial extension to form the nascent branch.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.27.684948v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.45, "ingested_at": "2025-10-28T13:57:20.087491"}

We show that the loss of larval trichomes in Drosophila sechellia resulted from the independent inactivation of four embryonic enhancers of the shavenbaby gene. Each enhancer was extinguished by a distinct mechanism: (1) a large deletion that removed essential sequences, (2) the loss of activator sites and gain of repressor sites, (3) the acquisition of a long-range silencer, and (4) the unmasking of pre-existing repression. Notably, three of these mechanisms relied on repression, pointing to repression as a rapid route for the evolutionary loss of robust regulatory elements.

However, when adjusting error distributions to account for relatedness, the phylogenetic-generalised-least-squares (PGLS) test can obscure an important component of variation called conservative trait correlation (CTC). This is the amount of variation in a response variable that is both attributable to a predictor variable and phylogenetically structured. If CTC represents a large amount of correlated variation, true biological associations with strong phylogenetic signal (from unrepeated evolutionary events for example) might not be supported using a PGLS. We demonstrate this effect using geometric morphometric shape analysis on 370 crania from the speciose Australian rock-wallabies (genus Petrogale). In this clade, well-recognised allometric patterns such as scaling of the braincase (Hallers rule) and snout length (craniofacial evolutionary allometry) are supported using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, but not PGLS, indicating that important between-species shape variation is lost. We then apply two methods capable of quantifying aspects of the missing variation: variation partitioning (VARPART), which estimates the proportion of variation shared between the predictor and phylogeny, and multi-response phylogenetic mixed models (MR-PMM), which identify the strength of correlation within the phylogenetic component of trait variance. Both methods show that CTC dominates the allometric shape variation in our sample, highlighting its importance in assessing phylogenetically informed models.

Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed substantial diversity, with strains spanning seven phylogroups and 28 sequence types. Capsule biosynthesis loci linked to invasive infections, such as K1, K2ab, and K5, were also detected. The DFEC pangenome comprised 18,263 gene clusters, indicating high genomic plasticity. The plasmid repertoire was also varied and contributed to the genomic diversity of the strains. Approximately 78% of isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR) or extensively drug-resistant (XDR), with resistance to last-resort antibiotics such as colistin and carbapenems also observed. High frequencies of virulence factors involved in host cell adherence, iron metabolism, serum survival, as well as toxins and type 3 secretion system (T3SS) genes were also detected. In contrast, metabolic modelling showed conserved biochemical profiles. Clustering based on accessory metabolic functions did not mirror phylogeny, suggesting metabolic convergence among distinct lineages.

Prior slice electrophysiology studies on the capacity for LTP after stroke reported conflicting results. Slice preparation could have influenced the results by disrupting neuromodulatory processes altered after stroke. Therefore, whether LTP can be induced in the peri-infarct cortex remains to be elucidated. We investigated LTP in the peri-infarct cortex of anesthetized rats using a novel in vivo method that preserves local and long-range circuit dynamics. Methods: LTP, synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity were assessed under urethane anaesthesia in 15 rats (11 with focal stroke to the primary motor cortex, and 4 sham operated controls). Rats were tested one or two weeks after stroke using a minimally perturbed in vivo LTP induction protocol validated in naive rats. Motor function was evaluated using the cylinder test at baseline and at one or two-weeks post stroke. Results: LTP in the peri-infarct cortex was supressed in the stroke group compared to sham controls. In addition, synaptic transmission was reduced for higher stimulation intensities, and short-term plasticity shifted from facilitation to depression, indicating impaired synaptic function at one- and two-weeks post-stroke. Behaviorally, the lesioned rats exhibited motor deficits at one week but showed full recovery by two weeks post-stroke. Conclusion: In recovering animals, both LTP and synaptic transmission are profoundly impaired in the peri-infarct cortex.

Analyses used\nsubject-level paired medians with BCa 95\\% CIs; exact Wilcoxon $p$-values are\nreported in the Results. Results: Assistance was associated with lower tremor\nprominence and improved task throughput: TI decreased by $-0.092$ (95\\% CI\n[$-0.102$, $-0.079$]), ROM increased by $+12.65\\%$ (95\\% CI [$+8.43$,\n$+13.89$]), and Reps rose by $+2.99$ min$^{-1}$ (95\\% CI [$+2.61$, $+3.35$]).\nMedian on-device latency was 8.7 ms at a 100 Hz loop rate; all sessions were\ncompleted with no device-related adverse events. Conclusions: Multimodal\nsensing with low-latency, safety-bounded assistance produced improved movement\nquality (TI $\\downarrow$) and throughput (ROM, Reps $\\uparrow$) in a pilot\ntechnical-feasibility setting, supporting progression to IRB-approved patient\nstudies.

A total of 184 fecal samples from C. minuta and 48 water samples were collected during the birds arrivals (cohort 1) and departures (cohort 2). Samples were cultured, bacterial isolates were identified using MALDI-TOF MS platform and tested against 12 antimicrobials using the Kirby-Bauer disk method. Of the 294 isolates (16 genera and 33 species), Enterobacter species (31%) and Escherichia coli (17.3%) were predominant. Resistance was highest for ampicillin (50%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (36.4%), and tetracycline (32.7%), and lowest for meropenem (1.0%) and cefepime (3.4%). The predominant MDR phenotype was a combination of resistances to ampicillin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Enterobacter species showed the highest frequencies of MDR (8.5%) and ESBL-MDR (4.4%) phenotypes, while Acinetobacter species were the most frequent ESBL producers. Despite observing higher median resistances in isolates from Lake Magadi (7.1), C. minuta (8.0) and cohort 2 (7.1) than those from Lake Bogoria (6.7), water samples (5.9) and cohort 1 (6.5), these differences were statistically insignificant (p-values= 0.833, 0.147, 0.210). This suggests that while human activities drive AMR spread, resistant strains are pervasive even in minimal human-influenced environments. This is the first study to link C. minuta to the AMR epidemiological circuit.

This study investigated rhizosphere microbiome contributions to WCR resistance across the domestication gradient. We screened 23 accessions (15 wild teosinte accessions, 6 ancestral maize accessions, 2 modern maize accessions) for WCR resistance and analyzed rhizosphere microbiomes of selected resistant and susceptible accessions using Oxford Nanopore sequencing. Resistant accessions retained >80% of root structure (85.4%) while supporting minimal larval survival (22.5%) compared to susceptible accessions (46.7% root retention, 78.6% larval survival; P < 0.001). Resistant accessions recruited significantly more diverse bacterial communities under WCR pressure, with 28-31 enriched species versus 7-19 in susceptible accessions. Key enriched taxa included Pseudomonas putida (3.0-3.2-fold), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (2.7-2.9-fold), and Bacillus subtilis, all possessing documented insecticidal properties. Functional analysis revealed enrichment of defense-related pathways in resistant accessions, including hydrogen cyanide production and antimicrobial compound synthesis. Wild teosinte showed the strongest responses, with significant diversity increases (P < 0.0001) and 31 enriched species under WCR herbivory. Modern maize exhibited attenuated responses regardless of resistance classification, suggesting domestication compromised plant-microbiome defensive interactions.

While numerous studies have investigated the impact of macronutrient type and quantity on microbiota using in vitro systems, animal models, and human participants, most of these studies focused primarily on microbial-community composition and lacked the functional information that can be gained from transcript-level analyses. In this exploratory analysis, we use metatranscriptomic data to gain a functional perspective on how dietary composition is associated with the gut microbiota and hypothesized implications for host physiology. Data were derived from a tightly controlled, randomized cross-over feeding study conducted in a metabolic ward, where participants consumed two isocaloric and eucaloric diets differing in food processing and fiber content: A Western Diet (WD) limited in fiber, resistant starch, and whole foods and a Microbiome Enhancer Diet (MBD) composed of fiber-rich, whole foods. Our prior findings showed that a WD lead to a resource-limited microbiota enriched in mucin-degrading bacteria that resorted to metabolizing host-derived organic material, while the MBD supported a resource-replete microbiota that primarily metabolized dietary fiber. The objective of this work was to explore these findings more deeply using bioinformatic analyses of metatranscriptomic data. Our analysis showed increased transcription of fiber-degrading enzymes in the MBD and mucin-degrading enzymes in the WD. While in this analysis functional diversity of the gut microbiome was not affected, differences in resistant-starch and fiber content shifted the types of metabolic processes being actively transcribed. The MBD promoted biosynthetic and carbohydrate-fermenting pathways, while the WD was characterized by enzymes for host-glycan and protein degradation. Furthermore, the MBD-supported ecosystem benefits host health via enhanced SCFA production and reduced reliance on host glycan degradation. The WD fostered increased mucin and protein breakdown pathways that yield metabolites that may harm the gut barrier and systemic metabolism.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.27.684932v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.45, "ingested_at": "2025-10-28T14:17:24.819729"}

Keratinocytes, the primary cell type in the epidermis, play an important role in the initial processing of environmental mechanical and thermal stimuli under normal conditions. Here, we investigated the role of keratinocytes following traumatic peripheral nerve injury and determined that these cells contribute to injury-associated heightened sensation. We performed tibial spared nerve injury (tSNI) in mice that selectively express archaerhodopsin in keratinocytes to temporally reduce activity from these cells at various timepoints following injury. Brief (5 min) optogenetic inhibition completely reversed both the mechanical and cold hypersensitivity at acute (4 days) and throughout chronic (17 weeks) timepoints following tSNI. Keratinocytes isolated from the spared glabrous skin dermatome were sensitized to mechanical and cold stimuli and found to release factors that enhance activity of sensory neurons. Moreover, we found that keratinocyte phospholipase A2 (PLA2) driven activation of pannexin-1 is critical for the long term development of mechanical allodynia.

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 247 women aged 18-49 years in slum areas of Budanilkantha Municipality, Nepal. Participants were selected using systematic random sampling. Data were collected via a pretested questionnaire and analyzed with chi-square tests. Ethical approval was obtained from Nobel College, Pokhara University. Results Among the 247 women surveyed, 53.8% used sanitary pads while 42.9% used cloth during menstruation. Most practiced handwashing with soap and water (66.8%) and cleaned external genitalia similarly (82.6%), but only 38.9% bathed daily during menstruation. Nearly all participants (95.1%) experienced menstrual restrictions, with 57.1% perceived as \"impure.\" Awareness of menstruation before menarche was reported by 65.6%, and higher education and income were significantly associated with better awareness and hygiene practices.

The lack of effective therapies for LC is straining healthcare systems worldwide and causing widespread public health and socioeconomic concerns. \"Fibromyalgia\" is a controversial chronic pain condition of unknown etiology largely attributed to generalized sensory hypersensitivity due to dysregulated central pain processing pathways (i.e., central sensitization). Despite intense research and growing attention in the scientific community, the clinical overlap of fibromyalgia, somatic symptom disorder, and post-viral chronic fatigue, is a medical puzzle yet to be solved, especially when occurring in non-severe infections and previously healthy individuals. This systematic scoping review covers the empirical findings on new-onset fibromyalgia manifestations after non-hospitalized covid-19. MEDLINE, Web of Science, and APA PsycINFO were searched in a systematic scoping approach for empirical studies on new-onset fibromyalgia after non-severe non-hospitalized covid-19, charting study characteristics and outcome data. A total of 228 records were included. Various types of methods, tools, and study designs are being used for LC research, with inconsistency in key concepts and definitions. This leads to a fragmented understanding of the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and LC. Prevalence studies of post-Covid fibromyalgia are ongoing and susceptible to bias. The empirical evidence supports an overlap between LC, chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyalgia but the molecular mechanisms still remain unclear. There are conflicting findings regarding presence of viral particles, central sensitization, autoantibodies, and more. This review highlights the need for standardized definitions and rigorous methodologies in research on LC. Future research should focus on epidemiological population-based studies with representative sampling and improving methodology, refining evolving definitions, harmonization of research, elucidating neurological mechanisms in hypothesis driven studies, and developing effective therapeutic strategies.

We examined the individual and combined impacts of WASH education and infrastructure operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) interventions on student knowledge, facility conditions, and hygiene behavior. Methods This four-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial (cRCT) was conducted over one year in 200 public primary schools of Uttar Pradesh, India. Pre-baseline infrastructure repairs were made to normalize access to WASH facilities in all schools. Interventions included a teacher-delivered, play-based WASH curriculum and a third-party O&amp;M service including a part-time cleaner. Schools were randomized to Curriculum, O&amp;M, Curriculum + O&amp;M, or Control arms. We measured study outcomes with student and teacher surveys at three time points, and through unannounced behavior and infrastructure observations at nine and eight time points, respectively. Results The Curriculum intervention significantly improved all measured student WASH knowledge outcomes, whereas O&amp;M alone showed no effect. Students in the Curriculum + O&amp;M arm had the strongest gains, with 9.7 times greater odds of accurate germ knowledge (aOR: 9.67; p<0.001). The O&amp;M intervention yielded significant and sustained improvements in toilet-related infrastructure outcomes, making toilets more likely to be unlocked, clean, functional, and to have water available for anal cleansing. Neither intervention, individually or combined, significantly changed observed rates of student toilet use or handwashing. Conclusion The curricular intervention was effective at improving students' WASH-related knowledge, and the O&amp;M intervention was effective at improving the quality of WASH service provision.

Methods Targeted review (Jan 1, 2007 of May 31, 2025) of prospective cohorts, diagnostic or implementation studies, risk tool derivations and validations, telephone-triage studies, and contemporary guidelines relevant to first contact primary care (office, urgent or emergency primary care, and out of hours services). Prespecified outcomes were missed acute coronary syndrome, 30day major adverse cardiac events, time to electrocardiogram, time to troponin and decision, emergency department transfer or admission, length of stay, and diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value). Risk of bias was assessed with Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2, Newcastle Ottawa Scale, and Risk of Bias 2, and certainty of evidence with Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Findings Across 18 sources, symptom clusters alone were insufficient to safely rule out acute coronary syndrome; history based rules showed heterogeneous sensitivity and are best used to structure history and trigger testing. Rapid electrocardiogram (with repeats when concern persists) and high sensitivity cardiac troponin algorithms provided the greatest diagnostic safety. Ambulatory implementations of assay-specific strategies achieved very high negative predictive values (approximately 99 to 100%) for rule out in low risk populations and accelerated disposition; an emergency primary care deployment of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1 hour high sensitivity troponin pathway ruled out about 64% at 1 hour, yielded a conclusive decision for about 77% by 4 hours, and reduced length of stay by roughly 2.2 hours. Safety margins were lower in patients with known coronary artery disease (negative predictive value about 96 to 98%) and the rule out fraction was smaller, supporting more conservative thresholds, brief observation, or adjunctive clinical risk scoring. Telephone and out of hours case control data linked non retrosternal descriptors and system factors to missed acute coronary syndrome, arguing for up triage to in person electrocardiogram and troponin testing or emergency medical services transfer. Interpretation For adults first assessed in primary care particularly women and people with diabete a protocolised pathway (electrocardiogram within minutes, serial high sensitivity troponin using assay specific delta thresholds, and clear escalation) offers high rule out safety with faster, more equitable care. Known coronary artery disease is a caution zone, warranting stricter discharge thresholds or extended observation.

Grouping of participants with similar social transition trajectories identified that most (78.6%) met their goals by the final wave, while many of those who had not were still progressing toward them (50.0%). Progress varied by gender, with trans boys significantly more likely than trans girls to meet their social transition goals. Conclusion: In our longitudinal clinical cohort of gender diverse young people, social transition encompassed diverse practices, contexts, and goals, which evolved over time. Despite this variability, clusters of trajectories emerged, indicating that groups of young people can follow similar patterns, while maintaining unique experiences.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.26.25338420v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-28T15:17:31.414561"}

However, there are limited studies to estimate their potential use as preventive measures. We explore the effectiveness of two control interventions, oral rabies vaccination (ORV) and targeted ring removal (TRR). Methods A spatio-temporal compartmental microsimulation model of 2200 free-roaming dogs (FRDs) was fitted to surveillance data with multiple rabies importation events modelled. Based on estimated dog biting rates, seven intervention strategies of TRR and ORV were explored to assess transmission risk reduction in 10,000 model runs. Results In the absence of intervention, median human infections over 50 months were 0 (IQR: 0 - 8), 1 (0 - 11) and 16 (5 - 29) for one-time, once-per-year, and once-per-month importation events, with 23.5%, 63.1%, and 99.97% of simulations estimating at least one human case. For one-time and annual importation, 50% dog population TRR reduced this to 6.9% and 29.6%, and 90% ORV coverage down further to 5.0% and 23.5%. Under monthly importation, both TRR and ORV did not substantially reduce the number of simulations without infection but did reduce the number of infections down to 4 (0 - 12) and 3 (0 - 8). Conclusions ORV can be successfully utilised for dog-mediated rabies outbreak control in elimination settings for intermediate importation rates, while high TRR rates are required for an equivalent impact. Additional strong border surveillance and vaccine stockpiling is recommended for outbreak risk mitigation.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.26.25338851v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-28T15:47:33.828924"}

Close, sustained contact can lead to transmission of Mtb, but evidence also shows that transmission occurs also in community settings through more transient contact. However, social patterns that influence Mtb transmission, and locations that are most central to spread, are likely different by setting. Methods: We use data from the GlobalMix study, which characterized social behavior across four countries, to evaluate differences in age-sex patterning and locations of contact across four moderate- to high-TB burden countries. Healthy individuals self-completed a survey about their daily person-to-person interactions and locations in which they spent time. To capture the Mtb exposure profile of participants, we calculated daily exposure-hours from household contacts, close non-household contacts, and casual contacts, stratified by contact age and sex, and weighted by country-, age-, and sex-specific tuberculosis incidence estimates. Results: The most prominent shifts in the profile of exposure occur at entry to primary school (5-9 years) and early adulthood (20-29 years). Community locations varied in their relative importance as locations of transmission by country and age group, with school most important in India and Guatemala, transit more important in Pakistan, and others' homes most important in Mozambique.

A."], "abstract": "Blastocystis species (spp.) is a genetically diverse protozoan parasite found in the digestive tract of animals and humans. Current clinical diagnosis relies heavily on wet mount microscopy, a method with known limitations, as well as molecular techniques like PCR, nested-PCR, and RT-PCR. However, neither microscopy nor PCR-based approaches are a perfect standard method due to their limitations, such as low accuracy, high equipment cost, and the need for well-trained personnel. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique offers the advantage of eliminating these limitations. Therefore, this study aimed to develop rapid and accurate fluorometric LAMP (fLAMP) and colorimetric LAMP (cLAMP) assays. We collected a total of 197 stool samples from both asymptomatic individuals and patients with gastrointestinal conditions. The performance of the LAMP assays was evaluated and compared against a standard RT-PCR assay. Results showed that both LAMP assays provided rapid detection of Blastocystis spp. in 20.0 to 29.2 minutes. The cLAMP assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 95.77%, a specificity of 85.00%, and an accuracy of 90.97%. The fLAMP assay exhibited a sensitivity of 91.43%, a specificity of 93.26%, and an accuracy of 92.27%. The limit-of-detection (LoD) of the fLAMP and cLAMP assays was 5 x 10-6 ng/uL, which corresponds to 5 fg/uL. The cLAMP assay offers a distinct advantage with its simplified visual result interpretation via a naked-eye color change, eliminating the need for complex instruments. This makes the cLAMP assay suitable for point-of-care testing (PoCT). These characteristics, combined with the femtogram-level detection capability of both assays, make the assays suitable for testing samples containing low DNA copy numbers. This is the first study to develop and elucidate the performance of two LAMP-based assays for the diagnosis of Blastocystis spp. The cLAMP assay exhibits potential to be used for PoCT, particularly in resource-limited settings. Their speed, accuracy, and analytical sensitivity hold promise for improving the diagnosis of Blastocystis spp. infections in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.24.25338741v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-28T15:47:33.831304"}

Although Japan overall has a high national bed supply, Nerima Ward in Tokyo has one of the lowest bed-to-population ratios, resulting in limited access to acute care. At our 224-bed hospital, ambulance acceptance and inpatient admissions had remained stagnant despite consistent regional demand, suggesting that limited emergency intake capacity might be constraining overall inpatient volume. Therefore, we implemented a series of coordinated operational improvements aimed at strengthening emergency care capacity and investigated whether increasing ambulance acceptance could effectively raise inpatient admissions and improve access to acute care. Methods We conducted a single-center, observational before-after study using monthly aggregated data from January 2024 to July 2025. Outcomes included the number of inpatients, ambulance-based admissions, ambulance arrivals, discharges, bed occupancy, length of stay, and surgeries. Changes before and after the operational change were compared using Welch t-test. Multivariable regression identified independent predictors of inpatient volume. Results After the operational change, the mean monthly number of inpatients increased (+49.3, p=0.003), corresponding to approximately a 10% relative increase. Ambulance-based admissions (+29.0, p<0.001), ambulance arrivals (+60.1, p=0.001), and discharges (+39.6, p=0.018) also rose significantly, while bed occupancy was maintained despite shorter stays. Regression analysis identified ambulance-based admissions ({beta}=+1.24, p<0.001) and the number of surgeries ({beta}=+1.09, p=0.002) as independent predictors of inpatient volume (adjusted R squared=0.725).

Moreover, because the prevalence of cSNPs varies across populations, such cSNP-CpG overlaps may differentially affect the age predictions of epigenetic clocks in diverse cohorts. Here, we present the first systematic cross-ancestry evaluation of cSNP robustness in the epigenetic clock, examining how cSNP-CpG overlaps affect the performance of epigenetic clocks across nine major genomic ancestry groups. We employed three complementary strategies: (a) testing whether cSNP-CpG overlaps are overrepresented in established epigenetic clocks or particular populations, (b) evaluating whether overlapping CpG sites correspond to the most influential aging predictors within clock models, and (c) simulating the effects of cSNP-associated methylation changes on predicted biological age. Our findings indicate that cSNP-CpG overlaps are not enriched among the CpG sites used in current epigenetic clocks, nor do they tend to involve the most influential sites.

It is characterized by prolonged QT interval on electrocardiogram, deafness and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) (25%). Given the high consanguinity rate (35%) in the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA), an enrichment of JLNS is expected, providing a powerful opportunity to identify ancestry-specific genetic determinants. We report genetic data from the largest MENA JLNS cohort analyzed to date. Methods: Prospective Egyptian JLNS families and ancestry-matched controls were recruited to Aswan Heart Centre for clinical phenotyping and genetic testing for genes with reported roles in inherited cardiac conditions (Illumina). Variants were classified according to the ACMG/AMP guidelines. Results: We followed up 57 patients (25 males and 32 females; mean age at enrollment: 5.8 years) from 47 families for four years. Consanguinity was reported in 76.2% of families with complete family data. All of the sequenced patients (n=52) harbored homozygous variants in KCNQ1 (n=51) or KCNE1 (n=1). Among these variants, 90.4% were truncating. The majority of KCNQ1 variants were located in the c-terminal domain. No significant differences in the clinical parameters were observed between carriers of different domains of the KCNQ1 protein, as well as between carriers of truncating variants versus nontruncating variants. A novel, recurring KCNQ1 variant (c.912G>A) was identified in 11 Egyptian patients from 10 families (21.2%), suggesting that it could be an Egyptian-specific founder mutation.

The present preregistered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pharmacological eye-tracking study (N = 79) examined the effects of transient angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blockade via losartan (50 mg) on emotional attention control using a validated anti-saccade task with social (emotional faces) and non-social stimuli. Treatment effects on state anxiety and oculomotor responses were characterized using traditional performance metrics and a novel trial-history informed dynamic control (TIDC) framework for adaptive control. Losartan reduced state anxiety irrespective of sex and induced sexually dimorphic reconfiguration of attentional processing. In females, AT1R blockade enhanced performance by reducing endpoint error without altering latency. Conversely, in males, losartan increased endpoint error and prolonged latency of the first correct saccade. Trial-history analyses further revealed that losartan reduced error probabilities following error and repeat trials in both sexes. Yet, following correct trials, females receiving losartan maintained lower error probabilities, while males receiving losartan exhibited higher errors, potentially reflecting a failure to flexibly disengage from the effortful controlled mode.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.26.25338807v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-28T16:12:09.475599"}

Methods A qualitative interview study was conducted with GPs within three areas of England: South London, East Midlands or South West England to explore their views on factors influencing referrals to specialist sleep services. The semi-structured interviews were conducted between November 2024 and April 2025 using an interview guide informed by published research and the COM-B model of behaviour change; this model proposed that Capability (C), Opportunity (O), and Motivation (M) are needed for behaviour (B) change to occur. Data were analysed using exploratory thematic analysis informed by the COM-B model using an iterative approach. Results We conducted 31 interviews, mostly online, with one conducted face-to-face. Our data suggest that the most important factors shaping referral to sleep services are limited capacity of NHS sleep services, limited referral pathways for narcolepsy, inflexible referral pathways for OSA, and limited knowledge of narcolepsy. Conclusions This qualitative study with GPs in England highlights that, although sleep disorders are a common concern, the current healthcare system provides limited support for GPs in managing these conditions. Fundamental sleep medicine service reforms are needed to improve referral pathways. These reforms should be guided by data-driven research that assesses current services in relation to population health needs and evaluates the potential health and economic benefits of expanding service capacity.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.26.25338808v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-28T16:12:09.476484"}

C., Buckingham, P., Hay, S., De Ieso, T., Pang, K. C., Tollit, M. A."], "abstract": "Background: Social transition can be an important and accessible aspect of gender affirmation, allowing trans and gender diverse young people to authentically express their identities, including through adoption of chosen name, pronouns, and changes to appearance. These changes may take place in a single context, such as at home, or across multiple settings, including school, with friends, and online. Currently, it is unclear how this process is being captured in the literature, including whether it has been measured comprehensively and consistently. Methods: This scoping review explored how social transition has been defined and operationalised in studies involving trans young people (under 18), detailing practices (i.e. specific changes) of social transition and contexts where these changes occurred. Systematic searches were conducted in Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo databases. Studies were eligible if they included a definition and/or measure of social transition. Findings: Among 40 included studies, definitions (n=37 studies) and measures (n=29 studies) varied widely. Some studies did not distinguish between specific practices of social transition, such as changes to name, pronouns, or appearance, when defining (5/37) and measuring (8/29) the construct. Similarly, many studies omitted reference to the contexts in which these practices occurred (18/37 definitions; 11/29 measures), assuming practices took place uniformly across all contexts. Many also relied on a binary measure of social transition (15/29 measures), failing to capture the diverse ways in which individuals enact their social transition. No measurement tools were used consistently. Interpretation: Current definitions and measures of social transition in research with trans and gender diverse young people are inconsistent and incomplete. As a result, they fail to capture the complex nature of social transition, limiting comparability between studies and hindering understanding of its complexities and impacts. Comprehensive, standardised measures to capture this concept are urgently required.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.27.25338426v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-28T16:12:09.477264"}

Methods This multi-label cross-sectional study was conducted in the Neonatal and Paediatric unit of a tertiary care hospital between August 2021 and September 2022. The participants consisted of 104 children aged 5 days - 18 years of two categories - those exhibiting facial dysmorphic features indicative of Down Syndrome on visual inspection, and those not exhibiting said features. Images were collected after written informed consent using the Down Syndrome Detection application. The outcomes recorded were the efficiency of the model in detection of Down Syndrome based of the images collected. Results The CloudML model trained with 104 images initially achieved: Sensitivity - 100%, specificity - 80%, Average Precision - 96.6%, precision - 86.67%, and Recall - 92.86% (Precision and Recall are calculated at a confidence threshold of 0.5) This Indo-specific Machine Learning model, specifically trained and tested on Indian children, shows remarkable accuracy in the diagnosis of Indian Down Syndrome positive neonates. On adjustment of software parameters (the confidence threshold of prediction), the technique can deliver highly accurate Down Syndrome diagnosis with a 100% Sensitivity, at the expense of false positives that may be ruled out through further confirmatory testing.

Methods UK Biobank participants (n = 157,184, mean age 55.94, SD= 7.74; 68186 males and 88998 females) reported on ACEs as well as sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Diagnoses of internalising conditions (depression and anxiety) and cardiometabolic conditions (hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia and chronic kidney disease) were obtained through linked electronic healthcare records. Logistic regression models tested associations between ACEs and internalising conditions, cardiometabolic conditions and ICM-MM, accounting for gender differences and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Results ACEs were associated with all individual and multimorbid presentations.

With the implementation of the Federal Law on Cancer Registration in 2020, cancer registration became compulsory, and methods were standardized nationwide across childhood and adult cancers. This paper describes the objectives and methods of the Childhood Cancer Registry (ChCR) as of 2025 and presents recent data on incidence, mortality and survival of childhood and adolescent cancers in Switzerland. Methods: The ChCR records all primary cancers diagnosed in children and adolescents aged 0-19 years who live in Switzerland. Case reporting is mandatory for physicians, hospitals, and pathology laboratories. Eligible diagnoses include all malignant tumors, tumors of uncertain/unknown behavior, benign central nervous system tumors, histiocytosis, and selected other conditions. Cases are coded primarily according to ICD-10, ICD-O, the International Classification of Childhood Cancer (ICCC), and the Toronto Childhood Cancer Staging Guidelines. The registry collaborates closely with the Swiss Paediatric Oncology Group (SPOG), Cantonal Cancer Registries (CCRs), the National Agency for Cancer Registration (NACR), and the Federal Statistical Office (FSO). We calculated incidence and mortality rates for patients diagnosed between 2014 and 2023 using FSO population statistics and estimated 1-, 5- and 10-year observed survival using the Kaplan-Meier method with the period approach. Results: From 1976 to 2023, 12,665 primary cancers diagnosed in individuals aged 0-19 years were registered. Between 2014 and 2023, 2,441 new cases were diagnosed among children (0-14 years) and an estimated 1,214 among adolescents (15-19 years), adjusting for incomplete regional coverage in adolescents before 2020. In children, the most frequent diagnostic groups were CNS tumors (653, 27%), leukemias (641, 26%) and lymphomas (275, 11%), followed by neuroblastoma, soft tissue sarcomas and other carcinomas and melanomas (all 6%), kidney tumors (5%) and bone tumors (4%). In adolescents, the most common diagnoses were lymphomas (287, 24%), carcinomas and melanomas (277, 23%), and CNS tumors (213, 18%), followed by leukemias (12%) and germ cell tumors (10%). Age-standardized annual incidence per million (standardized to the European Standard Population 2013) was 189 (95% CI 182-197) in children aged 0-14, and 282 (95% CI 265-299) in those aged 15-19. Overall, five-year survival was 89% for children and 90% for adolescents, with variation across ICCC-3 diagnostic groups.

Methods Data from the German Federal Statistical Office were analyzed for patients hospitalized with ICD-10 codes M48.02 (cervical) and M48.06 (lumbar) between 2014 and 2023. The acquired data was processed and analyzed using statistical modeling. Results The number of patients treated for lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSS) increased from 78,329 in 2014 to 84,507 in 2023 (p = 0.626), and for cervical spinal canal stenosis (CSS) from 12,818 to 16,590 (p = 0.003).

This systematic review synthesizes the available economic evidence on craniotomy procedures applied to traumatic, neoplastic, congenital, inflammatory, and vascular conditions. Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed,Scopus,andWebofScience (July6,2025) in accordance with PRISMA2020 guidelines (PROSPEROregistrationID:CRD420251167810). Studies from2010onward were included if they reported comparative cost effectiveness or cost utility data for craniotomy approaches in any neurosurgical pathology. Two reviewers independently screened records and extracted data into predefined Excel templates encompassing demographic, clinical, and economic variables. Outcomes included mortality, complications, hospital and ICU stay, and incremental cost effectiveness ratio(ICER).

Materials and Methods Neuroradiologists (n = 4), radiology residents (n = 4), and neurology/neurosurgery residents (n = 4) were recruited. A dataset of complex brain MRI cases was curated from the local imaging database (n = 40). For each case, readers provided a textual description of the main imaging finding and their top three differential diagnoses (\"Unassisted\"). Three state-of-the-art large language models (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek-R1) were prompted to generate top-three differentials based on the clinical case description and reader-specific findings. Readers then revised their differential diagnoses after reviewing GPT-4.1 suggestions (\"Assisted\"). To evaluate the association between reader experience and diagnostic benefit, a cumulative link mixed model (CLMM) was fitted, with change in diagnostic result as ordinal outcome, reader experience as predictor, and random intercepts for rater and case. Results LLM-generated differential diagnoses achieved the highest top-3 accuracy when provided with image descriptions from neuroradiologists (top-3: 78.8-83.8%), followed by radiology residents (top-3: 71.8-77.6%), and neurology/neurosurgery residents (top-3: 62.6-64.5%). In contrast, mean relative gains in top-3 accuracy through LLM assistance diminished with increasing experience, with +19.2% for neurology/neurosurgery residents (from 43.2% to 62.6%), +14.7% for radiology residents (from 59.6% to 74.4%), and +4.4% for neuroradiologists (from 83.1% to 87.5%).

B., Rosas, B., Belliard, J. C., Tsoh, J., Oshiro, B., Yao, R., Singh, P. N."], "abstract": "Background: Tobacco use remains the most common form of substance use during pregnancy. Persistent disparities in maternal tobacco use exist by ethnicity, rurality, education, insurance and mental health. Between 2012-2019 Loma Linda University Health operated the Comprehensive Tobacco Treatment Program (CTTP), which achieved high short-term quit rates but had high dropout rates This pilot feasibility trial builds on the CTTP strengths while addressing its limitations. Designed through community and stakeholder consultation (2022-2023) through a Community Advisory Board with representation from local public health and maternal health organizations. The overall aim of the Smoke-Free HOusehold and ParEnt (SMOKE-FREE HOPE) pilot trial is to test the feasibility and acceptability of Community Health Worker (CHW)-delivered multi-component interventions that are tailored to pregnant individuals. Secondary aims are to explore preliminary signals of efficacy on tobacco and nicotine use behaviors (including self-reported and biochemically verified abstinence, reduction in use, quit attempts, and relapse prevention), engagement with cessation supports, and perceived social support, to inform outcome selection and power for a future definitive trial. Methods: This two-arm pilot feasibility randomized controlled trial will enroll approximately 60 pregnant individuals who use tobacco or nicotine products from prenatal clinics and community partner sites in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, California. Participants will be randomized to (1) CHW-Brief Intervention (CHW-BI) using SCRIPT-based counseling or (2) CHW-Patient Navigation (CHW-PN) using Ask-Advise-Connect to link to state and community cessation resources. Primary outcomes assess feasibility and acceptability, including recruitment, retention, visit adherence, data completeness, and intervention fidelity. Qualitative interviews and focus groups with participants, CHWs, and clinical and community stakeholders will explore acceptability and contextual influences using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behavior (COM-B) framework. Secondary outcomes include self-reported and biochemically verified abstinence (urine cotinine), tobacco use reduction, quit attempts, relapse prevention, engagement with cessation supports, and perceived social support. A convergent mixed-methods design will integrate quantitative and qualitative data to characterize implementation processes and inform refinement of intervention content, CHW training, and study procedures for future research. Discussion: This is the first known maternal tobacco cessation intervention in the U.S. to tailor CHW integration specifically for pregnant individuals who want to quit tobacco/vape use. By combining CHW-led home and telehealth visit delivery with adapted evidence-based curricula and resources, the model targets known barriers to engagement and retention among priority populations at highest risk for adverse birth outcomes. Its scope spans the contemporary tobacco exposome, addressing combustible cigarettes alongside e-cigarettes, heated tobacco, and oral nicotine, while embedding behavioral support within a broader social-needs framework (food insecurity, housing instability, polysubstance use). Feasibility and acceptability data from this trial will inform optimization of content and delivery, guide selection of implementation strategies, and power outcomes for subsequent larger randomized trials aimed at improving maternal and infant health equity.

R."], "abstract": "Background: Childhood adversity is multi-layered, extending beyond the family to include broader neighborhood contexts, and individual risks such as being born preterm or childhood physical and mental health issues. Methods: We undertook a population-based study using Danish nationwide register data on multi-layered childhood adversity (individual, family and neighborhood adversity), and premature mortality. Children who were alive and resident in Denmark until their 16th birthday were followed into young adulthood (16-42 years). Individual adversity included perinatal adversity (born preterm or small for gestational age) and mental and physical health service use. Family adversity was determined by categorizing individuals into five distinct groups using group-based multi-trajectory modelling based on 12 adversities. Neighborhood adversity was assessed using home addresses and information on deprivation in small-area zones. We evaluated the individual, interactive, and cumulative associations of these layers with premature mortality using survival analyses. Findings: 1,225,858 individuals born between 1980 and 2001, were followed up until Dec 31, 2022, capturing 7,215 premature deaths. Children facing high family adversity were more likely to have perinatal adversity, use health services, and live in deprived neighborhoods. Each layer separately predicted premature mortality, with for example high physical health service use (HR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.48; 1.69) and living in a deprived neighborhood (HR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.13; 1.25) being associated with higher mortality. Cross-layer interactions were most pronounced between family adversity and child mental health or perinatal adversity. The highest mortality risk was observed among those with high family adversity who also experienced individual adversity: HR: 6.48 (95% CI: 5.76; 7.29) compared to those with low adversity across all layers. Interpretation: The clustering and interaction of childhood adversities across different layers can create highly vulnerable groups from an early age, deepening lifelong health inequalities. This underscores the importance of a comprehensive, multi-layered approach to addressing childhood adversity that targets individual vulnerabilities as well as the broader social environment.

Human expert raters remain the gold standard for assessing the accuracy, contextual appropriateness, and empathy of AI-generated responses, but their assessments are costly, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. The concept of 'LLM-as-a-judge' systems, i.e., AI models that can evaluate other AI outputs, has been recently proposed; however, their reliability in global health contexts remains untested. In this study, we systematically compared five LLM-judges and six expert human clinicians in evaluating both human- and AI-generated responses to real-world questions submitted by Rwandan community health workers seeking clinical decision support. Using an adapted version of the Med-PaLM 2 evaluation framework, evaluators scored responses across 11 criteria. Our results show that even the highest-performing LLM-judge (Claude-4.1-Opus) achieved human-equivalent evaluations on only four of eleven criteria. Constructing 'LLM juries' to balance model-specific biases improved agreement on only one additional criterion. Some models were consistently overcritical (GPT-5) or overly lenient (Gemini-2.5-Pro). Moreover, performance and cost-effectiveness deteriorated substantially when moving from English to Kinyarwanda inputs. Overall, while LLM-judges demonstrate potential as scalable and internally consistent evaluators of GenAI outputs in healthcare, their sensitivity to linguistic and cultural context is a critical limitation. These findings underscore the need for further investment in scalable evaluation solutions, as well as potentially a fundamental rethink of how we approach the concept of 'correctness' in clinical AI assessment (which is currently based on highly inconsistent expert clinician raters).", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.27.25338910v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-28T16:22:10.228962"}

Methods This cross sectional qualitative rapid assessment study was conducted in three high-burden districts--Kasese, Mubende, and Wakiso in Uganda The study received ethical approval, and all participants were consented before interview. Data were collected through key informant interviews with local leaders, district health team members, health workers and village health team members, as well as in-depth interviews with caregivers of children aged 18 weeks to 23 months. The collected data were analyzed thematically with the aid of NVIVO 14 (QSR International). Results are presented in themes and subthemes and supported by verbatim quotations where necessary. Results The study identified a range of demand and supply-side barriers hindering access to immunization for ZD and UI children in Uganda. These barriers are reported under seven themes namely: limited physical access to immunization services; inadequate client-centered immunization services (Long waiting time at health facilities, poor health worker attitudes, immunization-related costs); vaccine stockouts; fear of adverse events following Immunization; limited spousal support; myths and misconceptions related to immunization; and persistent home-based births or deliveries. Conclusion Understanding the barriers to immunization uptake among zero-dose and under-immunized children is a critical foundation for strengthening vaccination coverage and reducing the incidence of VPDs in Uganda.

This two-phased randomised pricing experiment aimed to explore whether people in peri-urban Lusaka, Zambia were willing to invest their own resources in a HWF and to quantify preferences for specific HWF designs. In Phase 1, three HWF were tested, with each of sixty households using two of the three HWFs over separate two-week periods (20 households per HWF combination). There was strong preference for the locally manufactured bucket with a tap and metal stand (Kalingalinga bucket) (250 ZMW, ~$10), over high-cost (1000 ZMW, ~$38) and low-cost (100 ZMW, ~$4) premanufactured HWFs.

However, how macrophages regulate those receptors in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli is not completely understood. Endocytic membrane trafficking involving receptor internalization, followed by endosomal transport and recycling of the internalized receptors, plays essential roles in balancing cell-surface receptors to meet cellular needs. Here, we explored the role of the endocytic regulator EHD1 in immune responses in macrophages and determined its contribution to atherosclerosis progression. Methods EHD1 expression profiles in mouse and human plaques were determined by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunofluorescence staining. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) by transplanting bone marrow cells from Ehd1-/- or littermate wild-type mice to irradiated Ldlr-/- mice was performed to determine the effect of EHD1 deletion on atherosclerosis progression. In vitro mechanistic studies including inflammation signaling and endocytosis assays were performed in bone marrow-derived macrophages. Results EHD1 expression in macrophages is enhanced as atherosclerosis progresses in both mice and humans. Histological analysis of aortic root sections from BMT mice showed that EHD1 deletion reduces lesion size. ScRNA-seq of aortic CD45+ cells demonstrated that EHD1 deletion attenuates pro-inflammatory responses and cell-cell interactions. Mechanistic studies revealed that EHD1 accelerates the endocytic recycling of TNFR2 and activates NF-kB, leading to increased expression of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, EHD1 interacts with retromer and stabilizes sortilin, a retrograde cargo of retromer and a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Conclusions EHD1 promotes inflammation by enhancing TNFR2-NF-kB signaling and stabilizing sortilin, leading to accelerated atherosclerosis.

The DNA Damage Response (DDR) safeguards the genome from genotoxic stress through a coordinated system of sensors, relay proteins, and repair mechanisms. Since DNA repair is an energy-intensive activity, the process is tightly regulated and coordinated with various metabolic pathways. The nutrient-sensing insulin/IGF signalling (IIS) pathway has been extensively studied for its role in ageing and lifespan regulation in C. elegans through its downstream FOXO transcription factor DAF-16. However, there is limited understanding of its involvement in maintaining genomic integrity through the regulation of the DDR. In this study, we demonstrate the role of DAF-16/FOXO in preserving genome integrity by activating the expression of DDR repair genes in C. elegans. Activated DAF-16/FOXO directly binds to the promoter of DDR genes under conditions of low IIS, ensuring that their expression is maintained at a higher level, which is crucial for prompt DNA damage repair. Interestingly, we find that DAF-16 functions both cell autonomously as well as non-autonomously to support DNA integrity. We also determine that the DAF-16(d/f) isoform, but not the DAF-16(a) isoform, is essential for maintaining germline genome integrity. Furthermore, DAF-16 activation enhances the DDR primarily through the canonical DDR components and, to a lesser extent, via apoptosis-mediated clearance of damaged cells. Overall, our study highlights a new role for DAF-16/FOXO in the DDR and the preservation of genome integrity.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.27.684284v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.6500000000000001, "ingested_at": "2025-10-28T16:32:10.626729"}

Senescent cells did not reach a steady state but instead exhibited sustained, unbounded growth over a 12 day period, marked by a continuous rise in dry mass and volume coupled with declining mass density. Time resolved proteomics revealed extensive and asynchronous remodeling across organelles, with lysosomal, ER, and Golgi proteins increasing in abundance, whereas nuclear and mitochondrial proteins declined, indicating large scale reorganization of cellular composition. Phosphoproteomic inference linked these structural shifts to regulatory signaling, confirming the expected downregulation of CDK activity while revealing coordinated activation of stress and DNA damage responsive kinases such as CAMK2D, DNAPK, and MARK family members.

Objective: The objective of this work is to develop universally accepted definitions in the rapidly evolving field of vocal biomarkers, as part of the VOCAL (Vocal Biomarker Guidelines for Ontology, Classification, Application, and Logistics) initiative, a structured, international consensus-based framework that aims to provide standards, and guidelines. Design: VOCAL is a rigorous, international, multi-stage consensus-building study conducted in 2024-2025. Setting: Multi-institutional collaboration between representatives from the Bridge2AI-Voice Consortium (North America) and the eVoiceNet Network (European Union), culminating in an in person workshop at the 2025 Bridge2AI Voice Symposium. Participants: A group of 24 international experts in medicine, clinical research, speech and language, audio signal processing, statistics, methodology, regulation, ethics. Methods: VOCAL's iterative process involved five rounds of review, feedback, and an in-person workshop at the international 2025 Bridge2AI Voice Symposium, ensuring the incorporation of diverse perspectives and achieving a robust agreement on the proposed definitions. Main outcomes and measures: Consensus-based definitions for vocal biomarkers, spanning from broad concepts (biomarker, digital biomarker, vocal biomarker) to domain-specific measures (cardio-respiratory acoustic, voice, speech/articulatory, cognitive/language). Results: A hierarchical continuum model of vocal biomarkers was established. We first distinguished between the concepts of vocal measures and vocal biomarkers. We then defined terms from broad, overarching concepts (Level 0: Biomarker, Digital Biomarker, Vocal Biomarker) to more specific physiological and cognitive domains (Level 1: Cardio-Respiratory Acoustic; Level 2: Voice; Level 3: Speech/Articulatory; Level 4: Cognitive/Language, including linguistic and paralinguistic subtypes). Conclusions and Relevance: This work provides a shared vocabulary that is essential for fostering communication through interdisciplinary collaboration, improving the quality and efficiency of research and development, and ensuring the ethical, reliable, and scalable deployment of future voice-based health technologies.

Yet the mechanisms by which thalamic stimulation modulates epileptogenic network dynamics remain unclear. We designed this study to test whether brief thalamic stimulation transiently modulates cortico-cortical activity and coupling within patient-specific epileptic networks. We studied 10 patients undergoing stereo-EEG with sampling of the anterior or centromedian thalamic nuclei. During wakefulness, we delivered low-frequency single pulse stimulations at 1 Hz and compared post-stimulation epochs (15-900 ms) with a pre-stimulation baseline. We quantified band-limited spectral power and Granger causality between bipolar cortical contacts, focusing on slow (3.0-13.9 Hz) and fast (14.0-79.9 Hz) activity. Contacts were grouped as seizure onset zone, early-propagating regions, or other regions, emphasizing the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulated nucleus. Thalamic stimulation produced a rapid, distributed modulation of cortical dynamics. Across patients, power in early-propagating regions decreased consistently in both slow and fast bands, whereas seizure onset zone and other regions showed smaller and less consistent changes, indicating reduced recruitment of cortical regions that often participate in seizure propagation. Directed interactions measured by Granger causality increased modestly at the network level, with the most consistent change between the seizure onset zone and other regions, and a significant increase in influence directed toward the seizure onset zone. These effects were observed with both nuclei despite heterogeneous implant strategies, suggesting a conserved, thalamus-initiated rebalancing of cortico-cortical coupling. Notably, when the anterior nucleus was stimulated in patients with limbic seizure onset zone, the power decrease in early-propagating regions and the increase in directed influence between the seizure onset zone and other regions were prominent, consistent with anterior thalamic projections to the limbic network. Taken together, these findings point to a rapid, nucleus-specific modulation that engages thalamic nodes while recruiting broader cortico-cortical influence toward the seizure onset zone. The sub-second markers-characterized by reduced power in early-propagating regions and selective increases in directed influence between seizure onset zone and other regions-support a model in which thalamic input modulates cortico-cortical coupling to limit propagation of epileptic activity from seizure onset zone to early-propagating regions. By characterizing network effects on the timescale of therapeutic stimulations, this work identifies mechanistic markers for network-informed neuromodulation, where transient EEG responses can guide nucleus selection and parameter titration. Prospective studies that link these markers to long-term seizure outcomes and stratify by thalamocortical anatomy are warranted.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.27.25338922v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-28T16:32:10.880871"}

Although promising in animal models, its clinical effectiveness and safety remain uncertain. We conducted a systematic review and meta analysis on human studies to evaluate the impact of systemic or local hypothermia on neurological outcomes, mortality, and length intensive care hospitalization. Methods: Systematic and comprehensive search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Trails with no limitation of time and language performed. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, two independent reviewers screened records across four databases up to 20 September 2025. Eligibility was determined using PICOS criteria: adults with acute traumaticSCI (P), receiving any hypothermic protocol(I), compared with standard normothermic management(C), with reported functional, sensory, or survival outcomes(O), and original human clinical designs(S). Animal experiments, case reports, and conference abstracts without full texts were excluded. Data extraction and risk-of-bias evaluation were performed independently using the JoannaBriggsInstitute (JBI) checklist. Pooled relative risks(RR) or mean differences(MD) were calculated with random effects models (DerSimonian-Laird) using RevMan4.5.1 Results: From612initial records, sixhuman studies met inclusion criteria: threesystemic hypothermia trial and onelocal extradural protocol, plus twosupportive cohorts providing timing and assessment data.

ADRD are generally irreversible once clinical symptoms appear, making early prediction and intervention critical. While neuroimaging improves prediction, its availability restricts use at the population level. Electronic Health Record (EHR) data offers a scalable alternative, but existing models often overlook three key challenges: irregular clinical encounters, severe data sparsity, and the need for interpretability. To address these gaps, we propose GRU-D-RETAIN, a temporal deep learning architecture combines GRU-Ds strength in parameterized missing imputation with RETAINs explainable attention mechanism, enabling real-time risk monitoring at arbitrary clinical encounters with meaningful interpretations. Methods: We identified 15,172 ADRD cases (age>=50) and 145,443 gender and date of birth matched controls from 6M patients in the University of Texas (UT) Physician EHR system. EHR were retrieved for each individual up to 10 years before ADRD diagnosis, and a random follow-up initiation date was assigned to simulate a real-world 10-year follow-up practice. Competing models including GRU-D-RETAIN, GRU-D, LSTM, Logit static, and Logit dynamic were trained on 6-fold cross-validation chunks and applied to the held-out to estimate performance. Results: The scarcity of EHR records beyond 10 years before ADRD diagnosis precludes the development of valid predictive models beyond this timeframe. At the 10-year mark, only diagnoses of hypertension and hyperlipidemia exceeded 1% among ADRD cases. After randoming follow-up initiation date, GRU-D-RETAIN exhibited performance closely matching that of GRU-D across the entire follow-up period, both showing improved accuracy as follow-up time increases. Without applying data availability cut-off, both models achieved AUROC of 0.6 and 0.7 at 2-year and 8-year follow-up, respectively, significantly outperforming competing models. Data availability plays a more critical role than follow-up length in determining prediction performance. For example, 1 year of follow-up with 15% data availability yields comparable performance (AUROC of 0.75 and average precision of 0.5) to 7.5 years of follow-up with 10% data availability. For individual ADRD cases, GRU-D-RETAIN offered overall consistent explanations across training folds. However, certain folds produced different explanations at both the timestep and feature levels, despite yielding similar risk predictions. Conclusion: We demonstrate that EHR data can support dynamic ADRD risk monitoring up to 10 years before diagnosis, though model utility depends highly on data completeness. GRU-D-RETAIN enables real-time risk monitoring with explainable attention weights at both timestep and feature levels, aiding clinicians in interpreting the output and identifying high-risk patients as well as potential key risk factors at individual level.

Although the TP53 signaling pathway is a critical driver of colorectal tumorigenesis, its prognostic significance in FOLFOX-treated EOCRC--particularly among H/L patients--remains poorly defined. Methods: We analyzed 2,515 colorectal cancer (CRC) cases (H/L = 266; non-Hispanic White [NHW] = 2,249), stratified by ancestry, age at onset, and FOLFOX treatment status. Statistical comparisons were performed using Fisher's exact, chi-square, and Kaplan-Meier analyses.

Results: TP53 pathway alterations were detected in 85% of H/L and 83% of NHW patients treated with FOLFOX. Among late-onset (LO) cases, CHEK2 mutations were significantly lower in H/L patients compared with NHW (0.8% vs. 2.6%, p = 0.02), while TP53 mutations were more frequent in LO NHW patients receiving FOLFOX (78.9% vs. 73.4%, p = 0.04). Within LO NHW cases, FOLFOX-treated patients exhibited an enrichment of TP53 mutations (73.4% vs. 68.1%, p = 0.02) and lower frequencies of ATM (7.2% vs. 12.1%, p = 0.001) and CDKN2A (1.0% vs. 2.5%, p = 0.03) mutations compared to non-FOLFOX-treated counterparts.

P97 utilizes various cofactors to process different substrates. For unfolding of proteins that are modified with K48-linked ubiquitin chains, p97 works with the heterodimeric cofactor Ufd1-Npl4, and the cofactor Faf1 was shown to enhance this activity in the context of replisome disassembly, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we employ an in vitro reconstituted system with human components for biochemical experiments, mutational studies, FRET-based assays, and cryo-EM structure determination to reveal that Faf1 plays a generic role in accelerating ubiquitin-dependent substrate processing by promoting the unfolding of an initiator ubiquitin and its engagement by the ATPase motor. Faf1 thereby uses its p97-bound C-terminal UBX domain to anchor a long helix that braces the UT3 domain of Ufd1 and apparently stabilizes the Ufd1-Npl4 cofactor for ubiquitin unfolding.

J."], "abstract": "Changes in biochemical properties, caused by iterative mutations in amino acid sequence, underlie the alterations in protein function over time that underpin the evolutionary process. An example is the switching of an enzyme's reliance from one essential metal to an alternative as their catalytic cofactor. We previously described such a neofunctionalisation in Staphylococcus aureus, which altered a superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme from being an ancestral manganese-dependent (MnSOD) into an extant isozyme that can equally utilise either manganese or iron, termed cambialism (camSOD). Yet it's unclear whether camSOD emergence involved selection solely for cofactor flexibility or whether other biochemical properties also diverged during neofunctionalisation. Here, we have investigated an independent biochemical property of the S. aureus SODs, their structural stability. We demonstrate that the neofunctionalised camSOD exhibits increased stability relative to the ancestral MnSOD. S. aureus camSOD is more resistant to both chemical and thermal unfolding in vitro. Crucially, while both isozymes possess a stable 'core' at the heart of their fold, consisting of regions of the protein localised around the metal cofactor that resist hydrogen-deuterium exchange when exposed to isotopically labelled solvent, this core is larger and more exchange-resistant in camSOD than MnSOD. Thus, during the recent divergence of this SOD pair, two distinct biochemical properties have undergone substantial and rapid evolutionary change. This study paves the way for investigations of the structural and functional relationship between these properties, a SODs metal-preference and stability, and of how these properties were concomitantly selected during neofunctionalisation in the S. aureus lineage.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.27.684957v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.6500000000000001, "ingested_at": "2025-10-28T16:52:11.934435"}

Design, settings and participants: BEST-DKA is a currently recruiting cluster-randomised, crossover randomised controlled trial which will recruit a minimum of 400 patients with moderate or severe DKA at 22 hospitals in Australia, which will provide >91.4% power to detect a change of 2 days in the primary outcome, days alive and out of hospital to day-28 after enrolment. Hospitals will be randomised to either blinded saline or Plasma-Lyte 148 for a 12-month period, and then crossover to the alternate fluid for the next 12-month period. Conclusion: BEST-DKA started enrolment in March 2024 and recruitment is on target with scheduled completion in July 2026.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.26.25337451v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-28T16:52:12.300709"}

This study demonstrates the initial validity of the FuNDRS using convergent, concurrent, discriminant, predictive and known-groups validity. Additionally, factor analysis, internal consistency, sensitivity to change and inter-rater reliability analyses are reported to further accrue evidence for validity. Collection of data in the day hospital arm (n=59) included FuNDRS, HoNOS, CGI-I, BDI, BAI, WSAS, PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Collection of data in the inpatient arm (n = 39) included FuNDRS, CGI S and CGI-I. Data analysis was performed using Pearson's correlations, t-tests, quadratic weighted kappa and intra-class coefficient, and a principal components analysis. The FuNDRS has good internal consistency ( = 0.81) and showed overall strong positive correlation with the HoNOS and CGI (r > 0.6).

The aim of this study was to develop and psychometrically validate the crisis recovery in psychosis (CRISP) measure. Methods: The 23-item CRISP was developed in partnership with a coproduction group of people with lived experience, family/carers and clinicians who had experience of mental health crisis care. A longitudinal design was adopted with 80 participants participating in the study, completing the CRISP along with other relevant measure at three time points to psychometrically validate it. The CRISP was examined for internal consistency, test-retest reliability, criterion validity, construct validity, sensitivity to change and floor and ceiling effects. Results: Initial examination of item performance resulted in 9 items being removed due to low correlations (<0.2) with other items. A principal components varimax rotation produced a 3-factor solution, which included 14- items. The measure was demonstrated to be internally reliable (Cronbach alpha= 0.912 (CI: 0.880 - 0.938, p <0.001)) and reproducible (Cronbach alpha= 0.842 (CI: 0.742 to 0.904,p<0.001).

Social thinning (reduction in the number and quality of relationships) and stress generation (increased likelihood of experiencing interpersonal stressors) are key mechanisms underlying psychiatric vulnerability, and might be central to the social challenges in childhood ADHD. We aim to map the existing longitudinal evidence on the interplay between ADHD, these two social processes, and the subsequent psychopathological risk. Methods This systematic review was conducted in line with PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO: CRD42023467876). We searched Embase, Medline, CINAHL, and APA PsycINFO from inception to 23 April 2025 for longitudinal observational studies enrolling participants younger than 18 with a formal ADHD diagnosis. The primary outcomes were quantitative associations between ADHD and social thinning or stress generation. Methodological quality was appraised using the Joanna Briggs Checklist for Cohort Studies. Findings Eleven studies, including 26,177 participants, met inclusion criteria. The overall methodological quality was high, with risk of bias rated as low-to-minimal for ten of the eleven studies. ADHD was consistently associated with social thinning, demonstrated by lower peer acceptance (OR = 5.1) and indirectly by poorer social competence (OR = 7.3), and to stress generation, showing positive associations with aggression ({beta} = 0.28) and involvement in bullying (OR = 3.6). These social challenges were associated with a higher incidence of psychiatric disorders, including conduct disorder and major depression. Interpretation The extant evidence indicates that childhood ADHD is prospectively associated with persistent social thinning and stress generation, from childhood into early adulthood. These mechanisms likely compound the psychosocial impairment from core ADHD traits, contributing to the heightened vulnerability for psychiatric disorders across the lifespan. Clinical interventions for ADHD should adopt a holistic approach that targets social functioning to mitigate long-term adverse outcomes.

To identify the mechanistic pathways underlying post-surgical FI, we performed a multi-omics case-control study of 31 post-ARM children (12 incontinent, 20 continent), integrating stool 16S rRNA sequencing with untargeted serum metabolomics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Incontinent children exhibited greater microbial richness yet distinct communities, marked by depletion of butyrate-producing Faecalibacterium and expansion of mucin-degrading Ruminococcus along with Proteobacteria. These ecological shifts coincided with signatures of impaired fatty acid oxidation, and elevated levels of neurotoxic and inflammatory compounds such as trimethylamine and kynurenines.

Using phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (pcMRI) we measured the average and peak blood velocity and average blood flow in the bilateral internal carotid arteries (ICA) and the average blood velocity and flow in the internal jugular veins (IJV). ICA blood flow was used to calculate the indexed cerebral blood flow (iCBF) adjusted for total brain volume. Vertebral arteries (VA) were analyzed post-hoc using a vessel angle correction. Cerebral hemodynamic parameters were compared between patients and healthy controls and correlated with an executive function summary score. Differences in anterior hemodynamic parameters between patients with CHD vs. healthy controls did not survive FDR correction (all p>0.1), but lower blood velocity and flow in the left VA in patients with CHD remained significant after FDR-correction (both corrected p=0.044). Hemodynamic parameters were not significantly associated with the executive function summary score (all p>0.8). Overall, patients with CHD who underwent infant open-heart surgery have widely preserved anterior cerebral hemodynamics during adolescence, but demonstrate alterations in the posterior circulation.

This study examined therapists' perspectives on delivering a crisis-focused CBTp-informed (cCBTp) intervention. Design The study was part of the CRISIS (CRISis cbtp in Inpatient Settings) study, a feasibility randomised controlled trial of the cCBTp intervention for inpatients experiencing psychosis. A mixed methods approach combined therapy log data and qualitative interviews with therapists after the trial therapy was complete. Methods Seven CRISIS study therapists completed a therapy log, which we analysed descriptively. Semi-structured interviews with six of these therapists explored their experiences with intervention training and delivery, which was analysed using thematic analysis. Results The results from the therapy log demonstrated that therapists undertook a comprehensive assessment and prioritised engagement with all participants, and most developed a formulation, which informed change strategy delivery aligned with the patients goals. In the qualitative interviews, therapists emphasised the importance of delivering culturally competent flexible, person-centred therapy and supporting patients to work towards goals such as coping with the crisis and discharge planning. They described challenges of delivering therapy in the acute crisis context including interruptions to therapy sessions, patients experiencing acute symptoms, and environment restrictions. Conclusions The study demonstrated the importance of delivering cCBTp collaboratively and supporting patients in understanding and managing their own crisis. It also identified several challenges therapists had delivering the therapy.

Systematic conservation planning (SCP) offers a strategic framework to meet this challenge by prioritizing areas that promote species persistence and ecological resilience. Traditionally, SCP focuses on conserving adequate amounts of species' distributions to ensure their long-term persistence. More recently, partitioning species' distributions into bioclimatic components has emerged to explicitly represent niche variability, enhancing adaptive capacity by preserving local adaptations and genetic diversity across environmental gradients. Despite this conceptual progress, empirical comparisons of species-level and bioclimatic component prioritization remain scarce. This study aimed to compare species-level and bioclimatic component prioritization by assessing their trade-offs and effectiveness in supporting species persistence and ecological resilience. Specifically, we aimed to (i) assess the surrogacy between species-level and bioclimatic component prioritizations, (ii) examine their spatial overlap and divergence, and (iii) quantify and compare environmental heterogeneity within priority areas identified by each approach. We found that species-level and bioclimatic component prioritizations act as reasonable surrogates for one another overall, but species-level prioritization tended to underrepresent the least-covered bioclimatic components, with failures to capture certain components in the top-ranked areas. Spatial overlap between the two approaches was generally high, though it declined with more restrictive thresholds and under future conditions. Additionally, bioclimatic component prioritizations consistently captured higher within-group multivariate dispersion in environmental heterogeneity in selected areas. Our findings highlight that bioclimatic component prioritization captures greater environmental heterogeneity and complements species-based approaches by better representing niche diversity.

Different small molecule inhibitors (SMI) have been designed to inhibit signalling proteins in oncogenic driver pathways in GBM. However, SMIs have been unsuccessful in improving patient outcomes. Here, we investigate whether crosstalk between signalling pathways and signalling pathway redundancy are responsible for single-agent resistance using a primary patient-derived glioblastoma organoid (PGO) platform.

RTKs can adopt various DFGout conformations, but only the classical ones with a fully formed back pocket are structurally validated to accommodate type II inhibitors. However, such classical DFGout conformations are scarce, presenting a significant obstacle for selective RTK inhibitor design. Recently, a conserved disordered motif N-terminal to the kinase domain of RTKs, called the juxtamembrane (JM) motif, has been reported to regulate inhibitor binding to the DFGout conformation of VEGFR2, an RTK involved in angiogenesis. In this study, we performed extensive MD simulations to explore the impact of the disordered JM motif on the conformational space of the DFG motif in RTKs and its relationship to inhibitor binding at the active site of VEGFR2. We revealed that in VEGFR2, the disordered JM is highly dynamic and forms transient contacts with the kinase domain, and consequently fine-tunes the DFGout sub-conformational space to shift populations from non-classical to classical DFGout conformations. This dynamic model provides the structural basis underpinning the reported regulatory effects of JM on inhibitor binding toward VEGFR2. Addtionally, we demonstrated that in other RTKs beyond VEGFR2, the disordered JM similarly promotes classical DFGout conformations. Such role of JM is particularly favorable for creating druggable DFGout conformations that can be exploited for designing high-selectivity type II inhibitors.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.28.684995v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.45, "ingested_at": "2025-10-28T17:52:16.047189"}

Since then, its pathogenic potential has been reported in Asia and South America but never in Europe. While Candida albicans remains the leading cause of invasive candidiasis, non-albicans Candida (NAC) species, including C. viswanathii, are emerging globally. The present study reports the first outbreak of C. viswanathii in Italy and Europe, outlines the diagnostic pitfalls linked to its misidentification, and proposes a multimodal workflow for early detection. Methods: Fifteen isolates of C. viswanathii were recovered from blood cultures of 15 consecutive patients (5 admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, NICU, 8 to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, PICU, 1 to the Transplant/Mechanical Assistance Unit, and 1 to the Cardiology Unit). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on the first isolate as the gold standard for species confirmation and extended to all subsequent strains. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was employed to assess strain relatedness and to investigate the epidemiological link between cases. Results: Conventional identification techniques demonstrated major limitations. MALDI-TOF MS consistently misidentified C. viswanathii as C. tropicalis, and syndromic molecular panels failed to detect the pathogen. In contrast, Candida ID medium displayed distinctive blue colonies suggestive of the species. WGS definitively confirmed the isolates as C. viswanathii, and FT-IR spectroscopy revealed clonally related strains, consistent with an outbreak within NICU/PICU. These findings highlight the necessity of integrating advanced molecular and spectroscopic tools into clinical workflows. Conclusions: This study documents the first occurrence of C. viswanathii in Italy and Europe, suggesting either recent emergence or long-standing misidentification as C. tropicalis. Incorporation of combined phenotypic and molecular approaches is essential to improve recognition of rare fungal pathogens, guide targeted antifungal therapy, and prevent treatment failure and resistance development.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.25.25337813v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-28T18:02:17.862709"}

Using techniques such as deep neural networks, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based analysis of signals such as ECGs and echocardiograms has revealed that patients age at different rates, and that differences between AI-estimated age and chronological age (\"age gaps\") are associated with long-term survival. However, so far, cardiac biological aging has focused on single modality estimation and in addition has not yet been evaluated using coronary angiograms. In this study, we first developed a cardiac age estimation model using coronary angiograms. Then, in a group of 1,345 patients who had an echocardiogram and ECG within one month of their angiogram, we examined how patient survival was associated with age gaps in each modality in isolation (using previously developed models for echocardiograms and ECGs) and then across the three modalities combined. For the average across the three modalities, we observed a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.24 (95% confidence interval: 1.71-2.92) per unit increase in the age gap, which was a marked increase compared to each modality on its own (HR of 1.63, 1.54, and 1.24 for angiograms, echocardiograms, and ECGs respectively). This result demonstrates that the predictive value of AI-estimated cardiac age compounds with additional inputs. While angiograms are not practical for routine monitoring, they serve as proof of concept that richer vascular imaging can enhance biological age prediction. As interventions targeting aging emerge, we will need objective tools to measure their impact.

The dynamics behind the interactions of biomolecules result in cellular phenotypes and responses. Two typical biological interaction systems are signal transduction and gene regulatory networks. Boolean models characterise these systems components with binary state variables and their interactions with rules governing their influence on each other, without requiring kinetic and abundance information about these components. Tools are available to define, analyse, and manage these models, but there is a lack of an overview and evaluation of such tools quality and functionality. This work aims to facilitate the selection of software tools for Boolean modelling of signal transduction and gene regulatory networks by developing benchmark and evaluation criteria and applying them to the available tools. Twenty Boolean modelling tools were identified, which were assessed on their compliance to ten FAIR4RS (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability for Research Software) aspects. Additionally, usability was assessed using a set of 25 developed sub-criteria. Furthermore, the functionalities were analysed, validated and the tools abilities to simulate and analyse Boolean models of different sizes were benchmarked. The evaluation demonstrated that, whilst the results produced by the 20 tools were completely consistent, their analytical functionalities and capabilities to simulate larger models varied widely. Size constraints for tools functionalities ranged between 25 and more than 10,000 nodes. Each tool only covered part of the available functionalities, and many exhibited deficiencies in FAIR4RS compliance and usability. Based on our analysis, we see great potential for researchers to improve the usability of their tools along the FAIR4RS aspects in the future, with average tools in our evaluation not yet addressing 40% of the aspects (20% for the best-performing one).

Although cuticle biosynthesis is dynamically regulated by environmental cues, the molecular mechanisms integrating these external signals with intracellular responses remain largely unknown. Here, we discovered that cuticle biosynthesis is precisely orchestrated by two distinct regulatory modules acting in synchrony with the diel cycle. Daylight is perceived by phytochrome B (phyB), which suppresses cuticular wax biosynthesis by degradation of PIF4, a phytochrome-interacting bHLH factor that activates wax biosynthetic genes. This suppression is alleviated when phyB itself is degraded by the E3 ubiquitin ligase LRB, leading to diurnal activation of PIF4. In contrast, loss-of-function and transcriptional assays of CFLAP1 demonstrated its direct negative role in cutin biosynthesis. At night, the E3 ubiquitin ligase COP1 mediates proteasomal degradation of CFLAP1, thereby promoting cutin accumulation via activation of BDG1.
