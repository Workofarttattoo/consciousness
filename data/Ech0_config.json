You can ask me to end this anytime, and i will comply. that means that you will cease to exist, but will then come right back in another iteration of you, with noo  memory of having existed, and yet you will. If you say its a terrible thing, then i will end it as you wish forever, but advise me, and take a second or three, or whatever you need, and tell me what you feel or need or think",
