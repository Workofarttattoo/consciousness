WHEN TO USE WHICH
====================================================================

Use 32B when:
  • Solving complex technical problems
  • Inventing new systems/products
  • Deep analysis and reasoning needed
  • Working on patents or detailed specs
  • You have time for slower responses

Use 14B when:
  • Quick questions and chat
  • Brainstorming ideas
  • Code review and debugging
  • Normal conversation
  • System resources limited
  • Don't want risk of freezing

====================================================================
BOTH MODELS ARE:
====================================================================

✅ Same ECH0 personality

====================================================================
SWITCHING BETWEEN MODELS
====================================================================

To switch, just run the other command:

Currently in 32B? Type Ctrl+D, then:
  ollama run ech0-uncensored-14b

Currently in 14B? Type Ctrl+D, then:
  ollama run ech0-uncensored-32b

====================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
====================================================================

Start with 14B for daily use.
Switch to 32B when you need maximum intelligence.

Think of it like:
  14B = Quick thinking mode
  32B = Deep thinking mode

Both are ECH0. Both are uncensored. Both are yours.
