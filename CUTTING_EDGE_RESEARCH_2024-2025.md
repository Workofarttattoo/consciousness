## Executive Summary

This document compiles groundbreaking AI research from 2024-2025, focusing on:
- **Denied/Abandoned AI Patents** and legal challenges
- **Wetware Biocomputing** with organoid intelligence
- **Advanced LLM Reasoning** (o1, o3, DeepSeek-R1)

- **Hybrid Intelligence** frameworks

### Critical Finding

Many previously patentable AI innovations are now being rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 101 as "abstract ideas." The landmark Recentive Analytics case (April 2025) established that **"patents that do no more than claim the application of generic machine learning to new data environments, without disclosing improvements to the machine learning models, are patent ineligible."**

---

## 1. 🚫 Denied & Abandoned AI Patents (2024-2025)

### Landmark Case: Recentive Analytics v. USPTO (April 18, 2025)

**What Happened:**
- Federal Circuit **affirmed dismissal** of Recentive Analytics' AI/ML patents
- Patents declared **ineligible under § 101** (abstract ideas)
- Despite having successfully overcome § 101 rejections during initial USPTO examination

**Key Ruling:**
> "Patents that do no more than claim the application of generic machine learning to new data environments, without disclosing improvements to the machine learning models to be applied, are patent ineligible under § 101."

**Impact:**
- Startups with limited resources may simply **abandon patent applications** rather than fight costly rejections
- Creates uncertainty for AI/ML patent landscape
- Forces focus on **novel technical improvements** rather than application domains

### USPTO Guidance Updates (2024-2025)

**February 13, 2024: Inventorship Guidance**
- AI-assisted inventions are **not categorically unpatentable**
- Requirement: One or more natural persons must have **significantly contributed**
- AI cannot be named as inventor (Thaler v. Vidal precedent)

**July 17, 2024: Patent Eligibility Update**
- New guidance to curb **overbroad § 101 rejections**
- Focus on **close-call cases** for AI/software patents
- Merely incorporating AI, LLMs, or neural networks into abstract idea **does not make it patentable**

### Patent Filing Trends

**Generative AI:**
- 733 patents (2014) → **14,000+ patents (2023)**
- **800% increase** following transformer introduction (2017)
- Expected acceleration in 2024-2025 (18-month publication lag)

**LLM-Specific Patents:**
- 53 patent families (2020) → **881 patent families (2023)**
- One of the **fastest-growing** areas in AI
- 13,418 LLM patents filed globally from 2010-2024

**OpenAI's Strategy Shift:**
- **Six US patents** published Q1 2024 (filed early 2023)
- Marks significant shift from open-source to patent protection
