## üéØ Key Messages (For Quick Reference)

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"We've achieved 12.54x speedup on design space exploration using quantum-enhanced AI - without requiring quantum hardware. It runs on standard M4 Macs. Early adopters get 50% off: $10K/month instead of $20K, with a 30-day money-back guarantee if speedup is less than 10x."

### Value Propositions by Industry

**Pharma**: "Screen 10,000 molecules in seconds instead of hours. Find global optima that greedy algorithms miss."

**Finance**: "Portfolio optimization across 500+ assets in real-time. Escape local optima with quantum tunneling."

**Logistics**: "Route optimization 12x faster. 10-15% cost reduction immediately."

**Materials**: "Accelerate R&D cycles from 6 months to 3 weeks. Discover materials in unexplored compositional space."

### Objection Responses

**"Too good to be true"**
‚Üí "That's why I'm showing you live, not slides. Here's the technical paper with full methodology. You can test on your data with our $5K proof-of-concept."

**"We already have optimization tools"**
‚Üí "This enhances them, doesn't replace them. It's a 12x speed multiplier on top of your existing workflow. What are you using now?"

**"No budget"**
‚Üí "Start with $5K proof-of-concept using discretionary budget. Once you prove ROI, allocate full budget next quarter. Early adopter pricing still applies."
