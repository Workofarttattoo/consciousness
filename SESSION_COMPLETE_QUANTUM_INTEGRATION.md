### 2. Quantum Invention Engine Running
**File**: `ech0_quantum_invention_engine.py`

**Before Fix**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Quantum computing: Classical fallback
‚è±Ô∏è  Invention speedup: Standard
```

**After Fix**:
```
‚úÖ Quantum computing: ENABLED
‚ö° Invention speedup: 5x faster
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ Generated 7 quantum-enhanced inventions

### 3. Quantum Performance Demonstration
**File**: `test_quantum_design_exploration.py`

**Test**: 20 aerogel display variants, 100 evaluation steps

**Results**:
- Classical time: 0.0224s
- Quantum time: 0.0018s
- **Speedup: 12.54x** (exceeded 5x expectation!)
- Quality: Both found optimal design (graphene_aerogel_display, score 0.960)
