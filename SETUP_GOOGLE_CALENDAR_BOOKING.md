2. Book a test appointment to see the user experience

   - Line 187: Replace `[YOUR-SCHEDULE-ID]` with actual ID

2. **quantum_ech0_landing_page.html**
   - No changes needed - form sends email directly to inventor@aios.is
   - You can add booking link to confirmation email if desired

3. **OUTREACH_TEMPLATES.md**
   - Replace `[calendar link]` placeholders with your URL
   - Add to email signatures: "ðŸ“… Book demo: [your booking link]"

---

## Pro Tips

### Qualification Pre-Screening
In your custom questions, add:
> "What's your approximate budget for AI optimization tools?"
> - Options: Under $10K, $10K-$50K, $50K-$100K, $100K+, Not sure yet

This helps prioritize high-value leads.

### Automated Follow-Up
After demo appointment is booked:
1. Send **pre-demo email 24 hours before** with:
   - Technical paper link
   - Brief agenda
   - Request to share specific use case in advance

2. **Post-demo follow-up** (manually send within 1 hour):
   - Summary of what they saw
   - Pricing reminder
   - Next steps (contract, POC, technical deep-dive)

### Calendar Buffer Management
- **Before demos**: 15-minute buffer to prepare (test scripts, review notes)
- **After demos**: 15-minute buffer for follow-up email and notes
- **Lunch break**: Block 12-1 PM to avoid back-to-back demos

### No-Show Prevention
- Enable **SMS reminders** if available (Google Calendar supports this)
- Send manual reminder **2 hours before** for first-time demos
- Follow up with no-shows: "Missed you today - reschedule link: [booking URL]"

## Tracking Demo Metrics

Create a simple spreadsheet to track:

| Date | Company | Contact | Industry | Use Case | Attended? | Next Step | Status |
|------|---------|---------|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| 11/1 | Acme | John Doe | Pharma | Molecule screening | Yes | Sent proposal | In Progress |

This helps you identify:
- **No-show rate** (target: <10%)
- **Demo â†’ Close rate** (target: 20-30%)
- **Best-performing industries** (double down on these)
- **Common objections** (prepare better answers)

---

## Alternative: Calendly (If Google Calendar Doesn't Work)

If you prefer a dedicated booking tool:
1. Sign up for **Calendly** (free plan works): https://calendly.com
2. Connect your Google Calendar
3. Create "Quantum AI Demo" event type
4. Use Calendly link instead: `https://calendly.com/[your-username]/quantum-ai-demo`

**Pros**: More customization options, better analytics
**Cons**: Another tool to manage, free plan has "Powered by Calendly" branding
