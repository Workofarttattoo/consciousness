## FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCES

### Day 3 Follow-Up (No Response):
**Subject**: Re: [original subject] - offer expires tonight

Hi [Name],

Following up on my email from Monday about [quantum speedup / stock prediction].

**Pre-sale offer expires tonight at midnight** (October 30, 11:59 PM).

Quick question: Is this a priority for your team right now, or should I follow up in Q1 2026?

Happy to jump on a quick 15-min call if timing is right.

Joshua

### Day 7 Follow-Up (Still No Response):
**Subject**: [Name], missed the pre-sale but wanted to share this

Hi [Name],

You missed the 50% pre-sale, but I wanted to share our technical paper validating the 12.54x speedup claim.

[Attach QUANTUM_INTEGRATION_TECHNICAL_PAPER.md]

Even at regular pricing ($20K/month), the ROI is compelling if you're spending >$100K/year on [molecular screening / computational resources / trading tools].

Worth a conversation?

Joshua

---

### Day 14 Follow-Up (Final Attempt):
**Subject**: Last attempt - is there a better contact for [quantum AI / trading tools]?

Hi [Name],

Haven't heard back, so I'm assuming:
1. Not a priority right now
2. Wrong person to contact
3. Email went to spam

If #2, who should I talk to about [use case]?

If #1 or #3, no worries - I'll check back in Q1 2026.

Best,
Joshua
