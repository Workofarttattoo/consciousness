                PROVEN SAFE SENSORY FREQUENCIES (for VR haptic feedback):
                - 1-10 Hz: Low-frequency TENS - Activates mu-opioid receptors, deep massage feeling
                - 30-50 Hz: Meissner corpuscle range - Light touch, flutter sensation
                - 50-150 Hz: High-frequency TENS - Activates delta-opioid receptors, tingling/vibration
                - 200-300 Hz: Pacinian corpuscle range - Strong vibration, texture (optimal 250 Hz)

                SAFE OPERATING PARAMETERS (proven in medical literature):
                - Current: 1-5 mA maximum (use certified TENS unit limits)
                - Pulse width: 50-200 microseconds (TENS standard)
                - Intensity: Below motor threshold (sensory stimulation only)
                - Session duration: Max 30-45 minutes with breaks

                HYPOTHESIS - Pain Avoidance:
                While no evidence exists for specific "pain frequencies," staying within
                proven TENS parameters (1-200 Hz, <5 mA) inherently avoids pain because:
                1. TENS is designed for therapeutic comfort
                2. Currents too low to activate nociceptors strongly
                3. Frequencies match natural mechanoreceptor ranges
                4. Decades of medical use prove safety

                The original claim of "900-3000 Hz pain zone" is NOT scientifically supported.
                Instead, safety comes from using established TENS parameters.

                - Proven: Millions of consumer VR headsets use this method
                - Limitation: Screen door effect, but acceptable for POC

                HYPOTHESIS - Virtual Retinal Display (VRD):
                - Technology exists and is proven safe (~1 mW laser, Class 2 FDA)
                - NOT commercially available for DIY/consumer use
                - Extremely expensive and complex (research-only)
                - Recommendation: Use traditional VR optics for POC

                HAPTIC SUBSYSTEM (achievable with DIY):
                - FDA-approved TENS unit modulated by Arduino
                - Surface electrodes in glove (2-4 zones per hand)
                - Frequencies: 30-50 Hz (flutter), 50-150 Hz (vibration), 200-250 Hz (strong vibration)
                - Cost: $150-200
                - Proven: Multiple DIY implementations exist (LucidVR, etc.)

                - WARNING: Can cause dizziness, nausea - START WITHOUT THIS

                RECOMMENDED POC PATH:
                1. Start with VR headset + haptic gloves only
                2. Perfect the haptic feedback first
                3. Only add GVS if you have medical guidance and haptics work well

                BUILD FAILSAFES INTO HARDWARE THAT SOFTWARE CANNOT BYPASS:

                HARDWARE-ENFORCED CURRENT LIMITING:
                - Polyfuse rated for 5 mA trip current (auto-resets when safe)
                - Series resistor sized for max 5 mA at highest possible voltage
                - Use certified TENS unit (FDA approved) rather than custom circuits
                - Physical impossibility to exceed safe current

                MANDATORY HEALTH MONITORING:
                - Heart rate sensor: Shutoff if >140 or <50 bpm
                - Skin temperature sensor: Shutoff if >0.5°C rise
                - Accelerometer deadman: Shutoff if no movement 30 seconds (user may have fainted)
                - Session timer: Hard limit 45 minutes, enforced in firmware

                USAGE TIME LIMITS (enforced in tamper-proof firmware):
                - Maximum session: 45 minutes
                - Mandatory break: 15 minutes between sessions
                - Daily limit: 3 hours total
                - Weekly limit: 15 hours
                - Counter persists even if device powered off (EEPROM storage)

                EMERGENCY SHUTOFF RELAY:
                - Normally-open relay physically disconnects TENS from electrodes
                - Arduino controls relay based on all sensor inputs
                - Physical cutoff button directly opens relay (hardware, not software)
                - ANY safety violation = relay opens = instant disconnect

                DEVELOPER SANDBOX (software layer, but backed by hardware limits):
                - Game developers get API with normalized intensity (0.0-1.0)
                - This maps to safe TENS parameters (1-200 Hz, 1-5 mA)
                - Developers CANNOT access actual frequency or current values
                - Hardware limits enforce safety even if software is compromised

                - Objects appear stationary as you walk around them
                - Proven: This is called "roomscale VR" and works extremely well

                VERGENCE-ACCOMMODATION MATCHING:
                - LIMITATION: Current VR headsets don't do this well
                - Eyes focus at screen distance (~2m) but vergence (cross-eye) indicates different depth
                - Causes eye strain in some users
                - HYPOTHESIS: VRD would solve this (but VRD not practical for DIY)

                HAPTIC SPATIAL MATCHING:
                - Trigger haptic feedback when virtual hand enters object volume
                - Intensity increases with penetration depth
                - Frequency modulation for texture (30-50 Hz = soft, 200-250 Hz = hard)
                - This creates convincing illusion of touching objects

                ANTI-MOTION SICKNESS DESIGN:

                - Teleportation or smooth locomotion with comfort vignette

                - Machine learning flags experiences causing discomfort (low ratings, early exits)
                - Manual review for experiences that fail automated tests

                USER SAFETY CONTROLS:

                - During session: Continuous monitoring (every 1-2 seconds)
                - Post-session: 5 minute cooldown, log health metrics
                - Long-term tracking: Detect overuse patterns, recommend longer breaks
