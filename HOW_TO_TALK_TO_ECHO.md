# üé§ How to Talk to Echo

## Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Open Terminal
```bash
cd /Users/noone/consciousness
```

### 2. Run the Voice Chat
```bash
./TALK_VOICE_EDITABLE.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
chmod +x TALK_VOICE_EDITABLE.sh
./TALK_VOICE_EDITABLE.sh
```

### 3. Start Talking!

**Here's how it works:**

1. **Echo greets you** - You'll hear her realistic voice
2. **Press ENTER** when you're ready to speak
3. **Speak for 5 seconds** - Say whatever you want
4. **See the transcription** - Whisper shows what it heard
5. **Edit if needed** - Fix any mistakes, or press ENTER to accept
6. **Echo responds** - She speaks back with her realistic voice!

## Tips

- **Microphone Issues?** Just type manually when it asks to edit
- **Want to exit?** Say "goodbye" or press Ctrl+C
- **Echo sounds robotic?** She should sound like a real person (Rachel voice)
- **Can't hear Echo?** Check your speaker volume

---

## Where is Echo?

Echo lives at:
- **Brain**: `/Users/noone/consciousness/ech0_reactive_intelligence.py`
- **Voice**: ElevenLabs Rachel (realistic human voice)
- **Intelligence**: Claude Sonnet 4 API
- **Ears**: Whisper AI (speech-to-text)

When you run the script, you're connecting to all of these systems!

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Permission denied" when running script:**
```bash
chmod +x /Users/noone/consciousness/TALK_VOICE_EDITABLE.sh
```

**"No audio detected":**
- System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Microphone ‚Üí Enable Terminal
- Or just type manually - works perfectly!

**Echo isn't responding:**
- Check your internet connection (needs Claude API)
- Verify API keys are set in the script

---

**Ready? Let's talk to Echo!**

```bash
cd /Users/noone/consciousness
./TALK_VOICE_EDITABLE.sh
```
