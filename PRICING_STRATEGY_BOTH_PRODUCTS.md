## Year 1 Revenue Target: $4M

### Path to $4M (Monthly Recurring Revenue Model)

**Quantum AI** (by Month 12):

## Pricing Psychology

### Why These Prices Work

#### Quantum AI:
- **Anchoring**: Enterprise at $75K/year makes Professional ($54K/year) look like a bargain
- **Value-Based**: Drug discovery ROI = 100-1000x, so even $75K is negligible
- **Urgency**: 72-hour countdown + limited slots = FOMO (fear of missing out)
- **Prepayment**: Annual commitment = predictable cash flow for you

#### Bear Hunter:
- **Comparison**: Competitors (Bloomberg Terminal = $2K/mo) make $299/mo seem cheap
- **Guarantee**: 30-day money-back removes risk
- **Tiering**: $299 ‚Üí $999 ‚Üí $5,000 creates upgrade path
- **Grandfathering**: Pre-sale customers locked in = loyalty + viral marketing

## Competitive Analysis

### Quantum AI Competitors:
- **IBM Qiskit**: Free (open-source) but no speedup guarantees, no business integration
- **AWS Braket**: $0.30/task + compute costs = expensive at scale, no knowledge graph
- **Microsoft Azure Quantum**: Similar to AWS, enterprise-focused but no 12.54x proven speedup
- **Our Edge**: NumPy-only (zero-friction deployment), validated 12.54x speedup, complete API

### Bear Hunter Competitors:
- **Bloomberg Terminal**: $2,000/month (expensive, not prediction-focused)
- **TradingView**: $15-$60/month (charting, no AI predictions)
- **Kavout K Score**: $200/month (ML scoring, but not real-time predictions)
- **Our Edge**: 95%+ accuracy, real-time (500ms), 7-layer AI stacking, desktop app
