## üìà PRICING PSYCHOLOGY

### Why $20 Works:

1. **Impulse Buy Threshold**: Under $25 = no approval needed
2. **Compared to Base**: $20 vs $49-$149 = small add-on (13-40%)
3. **Compared to Value**: $20 vs $500 enterprise quantum = 96% off
4. **Compared to Competition**: Burp Pro quantum features = N/A (don't exist)

### Anchoring:

**First**: Show enterprise quantum value ($500+)
**Then**: Show "was $500, now $20" (massive discount)
**Result**: $20 feels like a steal
