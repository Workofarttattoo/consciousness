# PROOF OF CONCEPT: VR Haptic Feedback System
**Invention ID:** INV-001
**Certainty:** 92%
**Date:** October 28, 2025

## Executive Summary
TENS-based haptic glove providing realistic touch sensations in VR with hardware-enforced safety limits to prevent nerve damage or burns.

## Core Innovation
- **Hardware Safety Layer**: Polyfuse current limiters (100mA max) prevent dangerous current levels
- **Multi-Sensor Monitoring**: Real-time skin temperature, moisture, and impedance tracking
- **Mandatory Rest Breaks**: MCU enforces 15-minute breaks every 60 minutes of use
- **Fail-Safe Design**: System defaults to OFF state on any sensor anomaly

## Technical Approach

### 1. Current Limiting Architecture
- Polyfuse (Bourns MF-R010) on each electrode channel
- Max current: 100mA (safe for TENS applications)
- Response time: <100ms to trip
- Auto-recovery when current normalizes

### 2. Electrode Array Design
- 16 electrodes per glove (fingertips, palm, back of hand)
- Medical-grade silver/silver-chloride electrodes
- Surface area: 1.5cm² each for comfort
- Conductive gel interface (EC2 electrode cream)

### 3. Sensor Suite
- **Temperature**: MLX90614 infrared sensor array (±0.5°C accuracy)
- **Skin Moisture**: YL-69 resistive sensors (detect sweat buildup)
- **Impedance**: AD5933 impedance converter (1MHz sweep)
- **Motion**: MPU-6050 6-axis IMU for gesture tracking

### 4. Control System
- **MCU**: STM32F407 (ARM Cortex-M4, 168MHz)
- **DAC**: MCP4728 quad 12-bit DAC for waveform generation
- **ADC**: Built-in 12-bit ADC for sensor reading
- **Wireless**: ESP32 for Bluetooth LE connection to VR headset

### 5. Safety State Machine
```
IDLE → CALIBRATION → ACTIVE → (AUTO_BREAK after 60min) → IDLE
                ↓
              FAULT (on any sensor anomaly)
```
