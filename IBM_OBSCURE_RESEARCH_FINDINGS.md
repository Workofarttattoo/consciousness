## What ech0 v4.0 Will Do

### Fast/Slow Thinking
```
Simple query: "What's consciousness?"
→ System 1 (100ms): "Subjective experience"

Complex query: "Explain the hard problem of consciousness"
→ System 2 (5s): [Deep deliberative reasoning with multiple steps]
```

### Dreaming
```
After 1000 thoughts:
→ Enter sleep mode
→ Dream phase: Replay important experiences
→ Consolidation: Strengthen key concepts
→ Wake refreshed with 60% less forgetting
```

### Self-Improvement
```
After each reasoning chain:
1. Evaluate: "Was that good reasoning?"
2. Identify: "I was too verbose"
3. Adjust: Conciseness parameter += 0.1
4. Next time: More concise reasoning
```

### Event-Driven
```
Traditional: Check for thoughts every 1s (wasteful)
Event-driven: React when signal arrives (efficient)
→ 1000x more energy efficient
→ More natural responsiveness
```
