### Template 1: Drug Discovery / Pharma

**Subject**: 12x faster molecular screening without quantum hardware?

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company]'s work on [specific project/area from their profile]. Impressive progress on [specific achievement].

Quick question: How long does your team currently spend screening molecular candidates during lead discovery?

We just validated a quantum-enhanced AI system that achieved **12.54x speedup** on design space exploration - without requiring actual quantum computers. It runs on standard M4 Macs.

Our early tests show it can:
- Screen 10,000+ candidates in seconds instead of hours
- Use quantum tunneling to escape local optima
- Find global solutions classical methods miss

**Early adopter offer**: 10-minute free demo + 50% off for first 10 customers.

Would a 10-minute demo showing the live 12x speedup be worth your time this week?

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for connecting on LinkedIn! As mentioned, I wanted to follow up about the quantum-enhanced AI system we discussed.

**Quick recap**:
- **12.54x measured speedup** on design space exploration
- Production-ready today (no quantum hardware required)
- Early adopter pricing: 50% off for first 10 customers

**What makes this different**:

Traditional approaches to [their specific problem]:
- Sequential evaluation (slow)
- Local optima traps (suboptimal solutions)
- Expensive quantum hardware (inaccessible)

Our approach:
- Quantum-inspired parallel exploration (12x faster)
- Tunneling mechanism (escapes local optima)
- Runs on M4 Mac (accessible today)

**Concrete example for [their industry]**:
[Customize - drug discovery example:]
Instead of screening 10,000 molecular candidates sequentially over hours, quantum tunneling explores the space in seconds and finds global optima that greedy algorithms miss.

**Free 10-minute demo includes**:
1. Live Bell state creation (quantum entanglement proof)
2. Benchmark showing 12.54x speedup
3. Analysis of your specific use case
4. Q&A with technical team

2. **Wait 24-48 hours** for connection acceptance
3. **Send outreach message** using templates above
4. **Follow up after 3 days** if no response
5. **Maximum 2 follow-ups** then move on

### Email Strategy
1. **Research first** - Understand their specific pain points
2. **Personalize subject line** with company name or specific problem
3. **Keep initial email under 200 words**
4. **Clear call-to-action** - specific days/times for demo
5. **Follow up after 3 business days** if no response
6. **Maximum 2 follow-ups** then pause

### Objection Handling

**"We don't have budget right now"**
‚Üí "Understood. Would a free 10-minute demo be valuable to evaluate for next quarter? We can also discuss phased onboarding to spread costs."

**"We need to see proof it works for our use case"**
‚Üí "Perfect - that's exactly what the free demo shows. We'll run your specific problem through the system live. If speedup &lt;10x, we offer 30-day money-back guarantee."

**"Sounds too good to be true"**
‚Üí "Fair skepticism! That's why we published a technical paper with full methodology. Happy to share that first, or connect you with [Reference Customer] who's already using it."

**"We're already working with [Competitor]"**
‚Üí "Great! How's that working for [specific metric]? Our approach is complementary - we optimize on top of existing workflows. 10-minute demo can show how we'd integrate."

**"Not the right time"**
‚Üí "Understood. When would be a better time? I'll follow up [specific date]. In the meantime, I'll send our technical paper for your review."
