Title: VR Haptic Feedback System with Hardware-Enforced Safety Architecture

Inventor: Joshua Hendricks Cole
Applicant: Corporation of Light (DBA)
Date: October 25, 2025

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to virtual reality haptic feedback systems with hardware-enforced safety mechanisms.

BACKGROUND

Existing VR haptic systems lack robust safety enforcement. TENS devices exist but are not VR-integrated.
No prior art combines hardware current limiting, content certification, and mandatory rest breaks.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A VR haptic system comprising:
1. Hardware current limiting circuit preventing excessive nerve stimulation
2. Multi-sensor health monitoring system with automatic session termination
3. Tamper-proof firmware enforcing mandatory rest breaks
4. Content certification system ensuring games cannot exceed safety limits
5. Emergency shutoff mechanism with redundant hardware and software triggers
6. Frequency band targeting system for mechanoreceptor-specific haptic feedback
7. Multimodal integration architecture combining retinal, vestibular, and haptic signals

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

[Full 10-15 page description would go here in actual filing]

The system uses a polyfuse rated for 5 mA to provide hardware current limiting.
A relay controlled by Arduino provides emergency shutoff capability.
Health sensors (MAX30102, MLX90614, MPU6050) continuously monitor user state.
Bluetooth LE communicates with VR headset running Unity/Unreal SDK.

CLAIMS

1. A virtual reality haptic feedback system comprising:
   (a) A hardware current limiting circuit configured to prevent current exceeding 5 mA
   (b) A multi-sensor health monitoring subsystem
   (c) An automatic session termination mechanism

2. The system of claim 1, wherein the hardware current limiting circuit comprises a polyfuse.

3. The system of claim 1, further comprising a relay-based emergency shutoff.

4. The system of claim 1, wherein health monitoring includes heart rate, temperature, and motion.

5. A method for safe VR haptic feedback comprising:
   (a) Monitoring user health in real-time
   (b) Limiting electrical stimulation to safe ranges (1-200 Hz, <5 mA)
   (c) Enforcing mandatory rest breaks after 30 minutes
   (d) Providing instant emergency shutoff capability
