      "summary": "We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings\nfrom observation pairs $(\\mathbf{y}, g \\cdot \\mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn\nfrom a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent\nspace and a group representation in which group actions correspond to\ninvertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases.\nWe validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured\ntransformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R",

      "summary": "When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive\nits predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is\ncritical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding\nspurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such\ndependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a\nself-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about\nvisual attributes that a model may rely ",
